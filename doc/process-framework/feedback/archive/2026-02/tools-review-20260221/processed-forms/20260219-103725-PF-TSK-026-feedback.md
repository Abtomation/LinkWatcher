## Task-Level Evaluation

### Overall Process Effectiveness
How effectively did the complete workflow support task completion?

**Rating (1-5)**: 4

**Comments**:
Session 1 workflow was effective. The concept document (PF-PRO-002) provided clear guidance on what to create. Creating two task definitions and two context maps in one session was achievable. The state file (PF-STA-044) provided a clear checklist to follow. Minor friction from script parameter discovery (New-ContextMap.ps1 uses `-WorkflowPhase` not `-TaskType`).

### Process Conciseness
Was the overall process appropriately streamlined without unnecessary steps or documentation overhead?

**Rating (1-5)**: 4

**Comments**:
The two-phase approach (script creates structural template, then AI customizes) is efficient. No unnecessary documentation steps. The concept document's Implementation Roadmap section directly mapped to state file steps, which minimized planning overhead. One improvement: the concept document could include a parameter reference for each script to avoid trial-and-error.

## Tool Evaluation

### Tool 1: New-Task.ps1 Script
**Purpose**: Used to create both task definition files — Feature Request Evaluation (PF-TSK-067) and Feature Enhancement (PF-TSK-068)

### Effectiveness
**Rating (1-5)**: 4

**Comments**:
Successfully created both task files with correct IDs, proper frontmatter, and structural template. ID registry updated automatically. Both files placed in correct directories (`01-planning/` and `04-implementation/` respectively).

### Clarity
**Rating (1-5)**: 4

**Comments**:
Parameters are clear: `-TaskType`, `-TaskName`, `-Category`, `-Description`. Script output clearly shows the created file path and assigned ID. The `-Category` parameter accepts phase folder names directly (e.g., "01-planning").

### Completeness
**Rating (1-5)**: 4

**Comments**:
Template includes all required sections: Purpose & Context, AI Agent Role, When to Use, Context Requirements, Process, Outputs, State Tracking, Task Completion Checklist, Next Tasks, Related Resources. The template structure is comprehensive and well-organized for customization.

### Efficiency
**Rating (1-5)**: 4

**Comments**:
Creating each task took seconds via script. The bulk of the work was customization, which is expected and necessary. The temp-file execution pattern adds a small overhead but is well-documented.

### Conciseness
**Rating (1-5)**: 4

**Comments**:
Template sections are appropriately sized. Placeholder content is minimal and clearly marked for replacement. No unnecessary boilerplate that needed removal.

### Tool 2: Task Template (PF-TEM-XXX)
**Purpose**: Structural template consumed by New-Task.ps1 to generate task definition files

#### Effectiveness
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: Template structure mapped well to both task types. The AI Agent Role section, Context Requirements with priority levels, and mandatory Task Completion Checklist all provided useful structure.

#### Clarity
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: Section headers and placeholder text clearly indicate what content belongs where. The Context Requirements section with Critical/Important/Reference tiers is particularly well-structured.

#### Completeness
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: All sections needed for a task definition are present. The Context Map link placeholder in Context Requirements was useful for connecting tasks to their visual guides.

#### Efficiency
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: No sections needed to be added or removed. The template was a good fit for both planning-phase and implementation-phase tasks without modification.

#### Conciseness
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: Template is appropriately sized. Each section serves a clear purpose. No redundant sections that needed deletion.

### Tool 3: New-ContextMap.ps1 Script
**Purpose**: Used to create context maps for both tasks — Feature Request Evaluation Map (PF-VIS-047) and Feature Enhancement Map (PF-VIS-048)

#### Effectiveness
**Rating (1-5)**: 3
**Comments**: Successfully created both context map files, but required parameter discovery. First attempt failed because `-TaskType` was used instead of the correct `-WorkflowPhase` parameter. Had to run `Get-Help` to discover the correct parameter names. Once correct parameters were known, it worked reliably.

#### Clarity
**Rating (1-5)**: 3
**Comments**: Parameter names are not intuitive. `-WorkflowPhase` is the parameter for what conceptually is a "category" or "directory" (e.g., "01-planning"). The naming doesn't match New-Task.ps1's `-Category` parameter for the same concept, creating inconsistency across scripts.

#### Completeness
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: Generated files include proper frontmatter, mermaid diagram placeholder, component sections (Critical/Important/Reference), relationships section, and implementation guidance. All necessary sections present.

#### Efficiency
**Rating (1-5)**: 3
**Comments**: The parameter discovery issue cost extra time on the first invocation. A consistent parameter naming convention across all file creation scripts would improve efficiency.

#### Conciseness
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: Context map template is appropriately sized. Mermaid diagram section, component classification, and relationship descriptions are all necessary and well-proportioned.

### Tool 4: Context Map Template
**Purpose**: Structural template consumed by New-ContextMap.ps1 to generate context map files

#### Effectiveness
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: Template provided good structure for both context maps. The three-tier component classification (Critical/Important/Reference) with corresponding mermaid classDef styles is particularly effective.

#### Clarity
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: Template sections clearly indicate what content belongs where. The mermaid diagram placeholder with classDef examples makes it easy to build the actual diagram.

#### Completeness
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: All sections needed for a context map are present: diagram, component descriptions at three priority levels, key relationships, implementation guidance, and related documentation links.

#### Efficiency
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: Template was a good fit for both planning and implementation context maps without needing structural changes.

#### Conciseness
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: Appropriately concise. Each section serves a clear purpose.

## Integration Assessment

### Tool Synergy
How well did the tools work together as a cohesive system?

**Rating (1-5)**: 4

**Comments**:
Good synergy between task creation and context map creation workflows. The task definition references its context map, and the context map references its task definition, creating a bidirectional link. ID registry is automatically updated by both scripts. The state file (PF-STA-044) effectively orchestrated the sequence.

### Workflow Efficiency
Was the sequence of tool usage logical and efficient?

**Rating (1-5)**: 4

**Comments**:
Natural sequence: create task definition first (to establish the ID and location), then create context map (which references the task). This worked well for both task pairs. The state file's step-by-step ordering reflected this logical sequence.

## Improvement Suggestions

### What worked well
- Two-phase creation (script + customization) is efficient and reliable
- ID registry auto-updates prevent ID conflicts
- State file step-by-step tracking prevented missed deliverables
- Task template structure is comprehensive and well-organized
- Context map three-tier component classification is effective

### What could be improved
- New-ContextMap.ps1 parameter naming inconsistency with New-Task.ps1 (`-WorkflowPhase` vs `-Category`)
- No parameter quick-reference in the concept document or state file for script invocations
- The concept document's Implementation Roadmap could include exact script invocation examples

### Specific suggestions
1. **Standardize parameter names**: Use `-Category` consistently across New-Task.ps1, New-ContextMap.ps1, and other file creation scripts for the phase/directory parameter
2. **Add script parameter cheat sheet**: Include exact invocation examples in the state file's roadmap steps to prevent trial-and-error
3. **Document New-ContextMap.ps1 parameters**: Update the script's comment-based help to include parameter examples

## Additional Context

### Task-specific challenges
- The main challenge was adapting task template content to be technology-agnostic. Both tasks needed to work for any project (Python, Flutter, etc.), so all guidance had to be process-focused rather than technology-specific.
- Designing the Feature Enhancement task to delegate domain knowledge to referenced task docs (rather than duplicating it) required careful thought about what the task should specify vs. what it should defer.

### Integration with other tools
- The concept document (PF-PRO-002) served as the primary design reference throughout
- The state file (PF-STA-044) served as the work orchestrator
- Both created tasks cross-reference each other and the concept document

## Follow-up Actions Required

### Tools Needing Detailed Feedback
- [x] New-ContextMap.ps1 - Scored 3 in Effectiveness and Clarity - Parameter naming inconsistency documented above

### Process Improvements to Consider
- [ ] Standardize parameter naming across all file creation scripts
- [ ] Add script invocation examples to state file roadmap steps

### Documentation Streamlining Opportunities
- No overdocumentation issues identified in Session 1

## Human User Feedback
*AI assistant MUST actively solicit user feedback before completing this section*

> **CRITICAL**: Do not fill this section without first asking the human user for their input.

Human partner feedback: "You should finish first one task and then start with the second task and not work on both at the same time." — The AI agent should complete each deliverable fully (create + customize + context map) before moving to the next one, rather than interleaving work across multiple deliverables.

---

## AI Assistant Summary
Session 1 of the Enhancement Workflow framework extension was productive and well-structured. Four artifacts were created successfully: two task definitions (PF-TSK-067, PF-TSK-068) and two context maps (PF-VIS-047, PF-VIS-048). The primary friction point was New-ContextMap.ps1's parameter naming inconsistency with other scripts. Overall, the tools and templates are mature and effective for task creation work. The key improvement opportunity is standardizing parameter names across all file creation scripts.
