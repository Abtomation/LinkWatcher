## Task-Level Evaluation

### Overall Process Effectiveness
How effectively did the complete workflow support task completion?

**Rating (1-5)**: 4

**Comments**:
The workflow is solid. This session surfaced an important tracking sync issue: two documents (FDD PD-FDD-025 and TDD PD-TDD-024 for 3.1.1) existed on disk but were incorrectly reset to ⬜ in the master state during Session 14. The process itself has no mechanism to detect this — it relies on human or agent memory. Once the discrepancy was found, the fix was straightforward. Script-based creation (New-FDD.ps1, New-tdd.ps1) then worked cleanly for 2.1.1 and 2.2.1.

### Process Conciseness
Was the overall process appropriately streamlined without unnecessary steps or documentation overhead?

**Rating (1-5)**: 3

**Comments**:
Three tracking surfaces must stay in sync: master state, feature tracking, and individual implementation state files. When any one surface is updated manually (especially during corrections), the others can lag. This session spent significant time on tracking fixes rather than new document creation. The process would benefit from a validation step at session start to catch sync drift before it compounds.

## Tool Evaluation

### Tool 1: New-FDD.ps1 (Script)
**Purpose**: Creates FDD template file and auto-updates feature-tracking.md and id-registry.json

#### Effectiveness
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: Works reliably. Creates the file, registers the ID, updates feature tracking in one command. The auto-update of feature tracking eliminates a manual step that was error-prone.

#### Clarity
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: Output clearly confirms the created file path, assigned ID, and what tracking files were updated. Easy to verify the result.

#### Completeness
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: Handles file creation, ID assignment, and feature tracking update. Does not update the master state or implementation state files — those remain manual, which is appropriate since they require richer content.

#### Efficiency
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: Single command produces three side-effects (file, id-registry, feature tracking). Far more efficient than manual creation + three separate edits.

#### Conciseness
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: Output is appropriately informative without being verbose. The "CRITICAL: TEMPLATE CREATED" warning is useful to ensure agents don't submit uncustomized templates.

### Tool 2: New-tdd.ps1 (Script)
**Purpose**: Creates Tier-appropriate TDD template and auto-updates feature tracking

#### Effectiveness
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: Works as designed. The Tier 2 template structure is sensible, though it includes Dart/Flutter-specific sections (UI components, state management, Dart code) that are irrelevant for Python backend features. These require replacement rather than just filling in.

#### Clarity
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: Output matches New-FDD.ps1 in quality. Clear confirmation of ID, path, and tracking update status.

#### Completeness
**Rating (1-5)**: 3
**Comments**: The Tier 2 template is generic and assumes a Flutter app context (Dart code examples, UI/state sections). For a Python project, the template sections need significant structural replacement rather than simple content filling. A Python-aware template variant would reduce customization effort.

#### Efficiency
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: Same as New-FDD.ps1 — single command, multiple side-effects. The template replacement effort is the bottleneck, not the script itself.

#### Conciseness
**Rating (1-5)**: 3
**Comments**: The generated template contains Dart code blocks that must be deleted before filling in Python content. For a Python project, this is noise that costs customization time. Minor issue but adds friction for every TDD created.

### Tool 3: PF-TSK-066 Retrospective Documentation Creation Task
**Purpose**: Provides the process definition, phase structure, and completion checklist for the documentation creation task

#### Effectiveness
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: The Extraction-First Principle (check existing confirmed docs before writing from scratch) is well-designed and reduces redundant work. The per-session feedback requirement keeps the process honest. The phase structure (assess → FDD → TDD → Test Spec → ADR) is clear.

#### Clarity
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: Process steps are clearly numbered. The priority order (Foundation → Tier 3 → Tier 2) is stated explicitly. The "Retrospective" marker requirement for all documents is well-specified.

#### Completeness
**Rating (1-5)**: 3
**Comments**: The task does not address the tracking sync risk between master state and actual files on disk. A session-start validation step ("verify master state matches actual files") would prevent the 3.1.1 discrepancy from recurring. The task also doesn't specify how to handle documents that exist on disk but aren't tracked (the exact situation encountered this session).

#### Efficiency
**Rating (1-5)**: 3
**Comments**: Three tracking surfaces (master state + feature tracking + implementation state files) require parallel updates after each document. This is the correct design for traceability, but the process could be streamlined with a script that updates all three surfaces from a single source-of-truth command.

#### Conciseness
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: The task definition is well-scoped. The completion checklist is thorough without being redundant.

## Integration Assessment

### Tool Synergy
How well did the tools work together as a cohesive system?

**Rating (1-5)**: 4

**Comments**:
New-FDD.ps1 and New-tdd.ps1 integrate cleanly with feature-tracking.md and id-registry.json. The scripts handle the mechanical parts; the agent handles the content customization. The division of labour is sensible. The gap is the master state, which the scripts don't touch — requiring manual sync after each script run.

### Workflow Efficiency
Was the sequence of tool usage logical and efficient?

**Rating (1-5)**: 3

**Comments**:
The sequence (FDD script → customize → TDD script → customize → update master state + impl state) is logical. However, discovering tracking drift at session start consumed the first third of the session. A session-start check ("run validation script or manually compare master state to directory contents") should be added to the process.

## Improvement Suggestions

### What worked well
- New-FDD.ps1 and New-tdd.ps1 reliably auto-update feature tracking and id-registry — eliminates manual steps that caused sync issues in earlier sessions
- The Extraction-First Principle effectively guides content reuse from confirmed existing documentation
- Per-session feedback forms keep the process accountable without being burdensome

### What could be improved
- The TDD Tier 2 template contains Dart/Flutter-specific sections irrelevant to Python projects — each TDD requires structural replacement before content can be added
- No mechanism exists to detect master state drift from actual files on disk — the 3.1.1 discrepancy could have gone undetected for multiple sessions
- Three tracking surfaces (master state + feature tracking + implementation state) require three parallel updates per document — a validation script or combined update command would reduce friction

### Specific suggestions
1. **Add a Python TDD template variant**: `tdd-t2-python-template.md` with Python-appropriate sections (component architecture, data flow, design decisions) instead of Dart UI/state sections. Either add a `-Language` parameter to New-tdd.ps1 or detect from project type.
2. **Add a session-start validation step to PF-TSK-066**: Before Phase 3 work, compare master state FDD/TDD columns against actual files in `/fdds/` and `/tdd/` directories. Could be a simple PowerShell one-liner or a dedicated `Validate-PhaseState.ps1` script.
3. **Consider a combined tracking update command**: A script that accepts feature ID + document IDs and updates master state, feature tracking, and implementation state file in one pass would reduce the three-surface manual update burden.

## Additional Context

### Task-specific challenges
The main challenge this session was the tracking discrepancy for 3.1.1 — the master state showed ⬜ for both FDD and TDD, but both documents existed on disk with valid IDs. This was caused by a Session 14 correction that over-corrected. The fix required careful cross-referencing of master state, feature tracking, implementation state files, and the actual `fdds/` and `tdd/` directories. This type of drift is inevitable in a multi-session manual tracking system and needs a systematic detection mechanism.

### Integration with other tools
New-FDD.ps1 and New-tdd.ps1 integrate well with each other (sequential: FDD first, then TDD). Both scripts depend on feature-tracking.md and id-registry.json being in a consistent state — any manual drift in those files causes script validation failures.

## Follow-up Actions Required

### Process Improvements to Consider
- [ ] Add session-start validation step to PF-TSK-066: verify master state FDD/TDD columns match actual files on disk
- [ ] Create Python-specific TDD Tier 2 template to reduce per-TDD structural replacement effort

### Documentation Streamlining Opportunities
- [ ] Consider whether all three tracking surfaces (master state + feature tracking + impl state) need per-document updates, or whether two would suffice with a derived third

## AI Assistant Summary

Session 15 was primarily a tracking-fix session that uncovered drift between the master state and actual files on disk, then created documentation for 2.1.1 (complete: FDD + TDD) and began 2.2.1 (FDD template only). The tools (New-FDD.ps1, New-tdd.ps1) work well and the main improvement opportunities are: (1) a Python-aware TDD template, and (2) a session-start validation step to catch tracking drift early. With 8 Tier 2 features still needing documentation (7 FDDs + 8 TDDs = 15 docs), and the scripts now confirmed working, subsequent sessions should be faster.
