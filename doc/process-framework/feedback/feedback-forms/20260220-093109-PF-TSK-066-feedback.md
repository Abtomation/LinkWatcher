# Tool Feedback Form

| Task Evaluated | PF-TSK-066 |
| Task Context | Retrospective Documentation Creation - Phase 3 Tier 2 FDD/TDD completion (Session 16) |
| Session Duration | Start: ~07:30, End: ~09:30, Total: ~120 minutes (across 2 compacted context segments) |
| Feedback Type | Multiple Tools |

## Task-Level Evaluation

### Overall Process Effectiveness
How effectively did the complete workflow support task completion?

**Rating (1-5)**: 4

**Comments**:
The hybrid approach (manual creation for first 4 features + script generation for last 3) was effective. Phase 3 is now fully complete with all 30 required documents created. The implementation state files provided excellent source data for populating FDDs and TDDs. The main friction was tracking synchronization between master state and feature tracking files.

### Process Conciseness
Was the overall process appropriately streamlined without unnecessary steps or documentation overhead?

**Rating (1-5)**: 3

**Comments**:
Two-surface tracking (master state + feature tracking) creates synchronization overhead. Script auto-updates to feature-tracking.md sometimes did not persist, requiring manual correction. The feedback form itself is heavyweight for what is essentially a documentation phase — a lighter-weight checkpoint would suffice for documentation-only sessions.

## Tool Evaluation

### Tool 1: New-FDD.ps1 (File Creation Script)
**Purpose**: Generate FDD template files with auto-assigned IDs and feature-tracking updates for 4.1.6, 5.1.1, 5.1.2

### Effectiveness
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: Successfully created 3 FDD templates with correct IDs (PD-FDD-031, 032, 033). Auto-updated id-registry.json correctly.

### Clarity
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: Script parameters are clear. Output messages confirm file creation and tracking updates.

### Completeness
**Rating (1-5)**: 3
**Comments**: Templates require extensive manual customization — the script creates structural scaffolding only. Feature-tracking auto-updates did not persist in at least one case, requiring manual correction.

### Efficiency
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: Significantly faster than creating files from scratch. The temp-file execution pattern works reliably.

### Conciseness
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: Template structure is appropriate — not over-specified. Provides good starting points without excessive boilerplate.

### Tool 2: New-tdd.ps1 (File Creation Script)
**Purpose**: Generate TDD template files for 4.1.6, 5.1.1, 5.1.2

#### Effectiveness
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: Created 3 TDD templates successfully after fixing the `-Tier` parameter issue.

#### Clarity
**Rating (1-5)**: 3
**Comments**: The `-Tier` parameter accepts only '1','2','3' but documentation examples showed 'Tier2' — caused a failed first attempt. ValidateSet should be documented more clearly.

#### Completeness
**Rating (1-5)**: 3
**Comments**: Same as New-FDD.ps1 — templates require extensive customization. Feature-tracking auto-updates did not persist.

#### Efficiency
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: Fast template generation. Batch execution of 3 scripts in sequence was efficient.

#### Conciseness
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: Tier 2 template is appropriately lighter than Tier 3 — correct level of structure.

### Tool 3: Retrospective Documentation Creation Task (PF-TSK-066)
**Purpose**: Task definition guiding Phase 3 documentation creation work

#### Effectiveness
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: Clear process for creating retrospective documentation from implementation state files. The phase boundary approach works well.

#### Clarity
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: Task steps are well-defined. The distinction between script-generated and manually-created documents is clear.

#### Completeness
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: Covers all required document types (FDD, TDD, ADR, Test Spec) with tier-appropriate requirements.

#### Efficiency
**Rating (1-5)**: 3
**Comments**: The two-surface tracking requirement (master state + feature tracking) adds overhead. A single source of truth would be more efficient.

#### Conciseness
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: Task definition is appropriately scoped without excessive process documentation.

## Integration Assessment

### Tool Synergy
**Rating (1-5)**: 4
**Comments**: New-FDD.ps1 and New-tdd.ps1 work well together. The implementation state files serve as excellent source data. The id-registry.json auto-update ensures ID uniqueness across scripts.

### Workflow Efficiency
**Rating (1-5)**: 3
**Comments**: The workflow of (1) run script → (2) read template → (3) customize with content → (4) update tracking is logical but has friction: scripts claim to update feature-tracking but changes don't always persist, requiring duplicate work.

## Improvement Suggestions

### What worked well
- Implementation state files as source data for FDD/TDD content — excellent structured input
- Script-generated templates save significant time over manual creation
- Parallel Edit calls for multiple features in same session
- Hybrid approach (manual for complex docs, scripts for simpler ones) balances quality and speed

### What could be improved
- Feature-tracking auto-update reliability in New-FDD.ps1 and New-tdd.ps1 — sometimes updates don't persist
- New-tdd.ps1 `-Tier` parameter documentation should show accepted values ('1','2','3') not 'Tier2'
- Two-surface tracking synchronization (master state ↔ feature tracking) adds overhead

### Specific suggestions
1. **Fix script persistence**: Investigate why New-FDD.ps1/New-tdd.ps1 feature-tracking updates sometimes don't persist (may be a file locking issue)
2. **Document ValidateSet values**: Add comment in New-tdd.ps1 showing accepted `-Tier` values: '1', '2', '3'
3. **Consider single tracking surface**: Evaluate if master state's feature inventory could be the sole tracking surface, eliminating feature-tracking.md synchronization

## Additional Context

### Task-specific challenges
- Context window compaction across multi-session work required re-reading files at session boundaries
- Write tool requires explicit Read before overwriting — system-reminder reads from compacted context don't count
- 14 documents created across Sessions 15-16 required careful ID tracking

### Integration with other tools
- id-registry.json integration with both scripts worked flawlessly for ID assignment
- Implementation state files (Sections 1-7) provided all data needed for FDD/TDD content

## Follow-up Actions Required

### Tools Needing Detailed Feedback
- No tools scored ≤3 overall requiring dedicated feedback

### Process Improvements to Consider
- [ ] Investigate feature-tracking.md auto-update persistence issue in New-FDD.ps1/New-tdd.ps1
- [ ] Add ValidateSet documentation to New-tdd.ps1 parameter help

### Documentation Streamlining Opportunities
- [ ] Consider reducing two-surface tracking to single source of truth for document status

## AI Assistant Summary

Phase 3 of the retrospective documentation creation (PF-TSK-066) is now fully complete. All 30 required documents have been created across Sessions 13-16: 12 FDDs, 12 TDDs, 1 Test Spec, 2 ADRs, and 3 foundation documents. The main improvement areas are script reliability for feature-tracking updates and reducing tracking synchronization overhead. The implementation state files proved to be an excellent source data format for generating retrospective documentation.
