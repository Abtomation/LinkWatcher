## Task-Level Evaluation

### Overall Process Effectiveness
**Rating (1-5)**: 5

**Comments**:
Very efficient for a small, focused code change. The streamlined PF-TSK-009 process (post-IMP-038) continues to be well-sized.

**Rating (1-5)**: 5

**Comments**:
No unnecessary steps. The linked-documents check (Step 9) confirmed existing guides already cover the pattern — avoided unnecessary edits.

## Improvement Suggestions

### What worked well
- Two-part solution (comment block + runtime warning) addresses both documentation and prevention
- Linked-document check confirmed no updates needed — saved time

### What could be improved
- No issues identified

### Specific suggestions
- None

## Additional Context

### Task-specific challenges
None — straightforward code change with clear requirements from the tracking entry.

### Integration with other tools
Script-development-quick-reference.md and document-creation-script-development-guide.md already document the correct pattern externally, so the module-level documentation completes the coverage at the source code level.

## Follow-up Actions Required

### Tools Needing Detailed Feedback
- None — all tools scored 5/5

### Process Improvements to Consider
- None

### Documentation Streamlining Opportunities
- None

## AI Assistant Summary
IMP-040 was a quick, well-defined improvement. Added comment blocks and runtime warnings to both replacement loops in DocumentManagement.psm1 to prevent the recurring pre-escaped brackets bug pattern. All tools performed optimally. The improvement addresses the root cause at the source code level, complementing existing guide-level documentation.
