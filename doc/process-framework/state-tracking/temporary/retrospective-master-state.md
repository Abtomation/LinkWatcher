## Feature Inventory

> **Instructions**: Create one table per feature category. Mark each column with ⬜ (not started), 🟡 (in progress), or ✅ (complete). Use N/A where a document is not required for the feature's tier.

### [Category 0: Category Name]

| Feature ID | Feature Name | Tier | Impl State | Analyzed | Assessed | FDD | TDD | Test Spec | ADR | Notes |
|------------|-------------|------|------------|----------|----------|-----|-----|-----------|-----|-------|
| [0.1.1] | [Feature Name] | [T?] | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | N/A | ⬜ | |
| [0.1.2] | [Feature Name] | [T?] | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | |

### [Category 1: Category Name]

| Feature ID | Feature Name | Tier | Impl State | Analyzed | Assessed | FDD | TDD | Test Spec | ADR | Notes |
