## 1. Feature Overview

### Feature Description

Dry-run mode is controlled by a `dry_run` flag on `LinkUpdater` (default `False`). When enabled, `_update_file_references()` logs `[DRY RUN] Would update X reference(s) in {file_path}` and returns `True` immediately — no file reads or writes occur. Statistics counters (`files_updated`, `references_updated`) are still incremented as if the update had run, giving an accurate count of what would change. The flag is set at construction time via the `dry_run` parameter or changed at runtime via `set_dry_run(enabled: bool)`.

`LinkWatcherService` exposes dry-run mode through its own `set_dry_run()` method, which passes the flag through to the `LinkUpdater` instance. The CLI `--dry-run` argument activates the flag when starting the watcher via `main.py`, enabling safe preview of all pending changes without any file modification.

### Business Value

- **User Need**: Users need to verify what would change before committing to file modifications across their project
- **Business Goal**: Provide a safe preview mode showing the full scope of pending reference updates without touching files
- **Success Metrics**: Zero file I/O in dry-run mode; statistics accurately report the number of pending changes; `[DRY RUN]` clearly labels all log output

### Scope

**In Scope**:

- `dry_run` constructor parameter and `set_dry_run()` API on `LinkUpdater`
- Early return from `_update_file_references()` with `[DRY RUN]` log entry
- Statistics accumulation (`files_updated`, `references_updated`) even in dry-run mode
- CLI `--dry-run` flag propagation through service layer

**Out of Scope**:

- Diff output showing exact line changes
- Report file generation
- Interactive confirmation prompts

## 6. Dependencies

### Feature Dependencies

**This Feature Depends On**:

- **[PF-FEA-021: link-updater](./2.2.1-link-updater-implementation-state.md)** (MAINTAINED)
  - Why: Dry-run flag is a property of `LinkUpdater`; implemented as early-return logic within `_update_file_references()`
  - Status: MAINTAINED
  - Impact if unavailable: Dry-run is integral to link-updater; cannot be separated

- **[PF-FEA-026: logging-framework](./3.1.1-logging-framework-implementation-state.md)** (MAINTAINED)
  - Why: `[DRY RUN] Would update...` log messages use the structured logging system
  - Status: MAINTAINED
  - Impact if unavailable: Dry-run output lost; flag still prevents writes but user gets no feedback

- **[PF-FEA-007: configuration-system](./0.1.4-configuration-system-implementation-state.md)** (MAINTAINED)
  - Why: `LinkWatcherConfig.dry_run_mode` attribute maps to this flag via the service layer
  - Status: MAINTAINED
  - Impact if unavailable: Config-driven dry-run unavailable; programmatic API still works

**Other Features Depend On This**:

- **[PF-FEA-003: core-architecture](./0.1.1-core-architecture-implementation-state.md)** (MAINTAINED)
  - Why: `main.py` CLI `--dry-run` flag and `LinkWatcherService.set_dry_run()` are the primary activation paths
  - Note: Service layer passes the flag through to `LinkUpdater`

### System Dependencies

**Required Services**:

_None_

**Required Packages**:

| Package | Version | Purpose | Added |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ----- |
| colorama | Any compatible | `Fore.CYAN` colouring for `[DRY RUN]` log output | Pre-existing |

### Code Dependencies

**Existing Code This Feature Imports**:

| Component | Used For | Methods/APIs Used | Notes |
| --------- | -------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| [linkwatcher/updater.py](../../../../linkwatcher/updater.py) | Implementation location | `dry_run` flag, `set_dry_run()`, `_update_file_references()` early return | Inline in LinkUpdater |
| [linkwatcher/service.py](../../../../linkwatcher/service.py) | Pass-through API | `set_dry_run()` → `self._updater.set_dry_run()` | Service layer forwarding |
| [linkwatcher/logging.py](../../../../linkwatcher/logging.py) | Logging | `get_logger()`, `logger.info()` | Log dry-run actions |
| [linkwatcher/config/settings.py](../../../../linkwatcher/config/settings.py) | Configuration | `LinkWatcherConfig`, `dry_run_mode` attribute | Dry-run flag source |

> **Note**: Also uses `colorama` (external, `Fore.CYAN`) for terminal color output.

**Reverse Code Dependencies** (files that import this feature):

| Component | How They Use This Feature | Methods/APIs Used | Notes |
| --------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| [main.py](../../../../main.py) | CLI interface for dry-run | `--dry-run` argument, passes to service | User-facing interface |
| Reverse dependencies of [link-updater (2.2.1)](./2.2.1-link-updater-implementation-state.md) and [core-architecture (0.1.1)](./0.1.1-core-architecture-implementation-state.md) also consume this feature indirectly. | | | |

## 7. Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Flag-Based Early Return with Statistics Still Accumulated

**Date**: 2026-02-18 (discovered)
**Context**: Dry-run mode must accurately preview the scope of pending changes without performing any file I/O. Simply blocking writes is insufficient if statistics are not accumulated — users need to know how many files and references would be affected.

**Options Considered**:

1. Skip all processing in dry-run: No statistics accumulated; user gets no information about scope
2. Full processing with write blocked at the last step: Wasteful; reads files unnecessarily
3. Early return after logging, with statistics still incremented (chosen): Zero file I/O; full statistics preview

**Decision Made**: Log `[DRY RUN] Would update...`, increment `files_updated` and `references_updated`, then return `True` immediately without reading or writing (Option 3)

**Rationale**: Statistics are the primary output of dry-run mode. Skipping them defeats the purpose. Early return is efficient — no file reads or writes occur.

**Implications**:

- Statistics in dry-run reflect what would happen, not what did happen — clearly labelled in log output
- Error counter is not incremented in dry-run (errors can only be discovered during actual file operations)

---

### Decision 2: set_dry_run() Runtime API

**Date**: 2026-02-18 (discovered)
**Context**: Dry-run mode may need to be toggled after `LinkUpdater` is instantiated — for example, when the CLI receives a signal or the service layer reads configuration at startup.

**Options Considered**:

1. Constructor-only `dry_run` parameter: Cannot change mode after instantiation; incompatible with service-layer pattern
2. `set_dry_run(enabled: bool)` runtime setter (chosen): Allows toggling at any point; consistent with `set_backup_enabled()`
3. Both constructor and runtime setter (implemented): Constructor for initial state; setter for runtime changes

**Decision Made**: Both constructor parameter `dry_run=False` and `set_dry_run(enabled: bool)` setter (Option 3)

**Rationale**: Constructor default ensures safe initial state. Runtime setter enables configuration-driven activation after instantiation. Symmetric with `set_backup_enabled()` for API consistency.

---

### Implementation Patterns Used

**Behavioural Pattern**:

- Pattern: Feature Flag (boolean toggle on `LinkUpdater` instance)
- Why: Dry-run is a mode of operation, not a separate class; flag cleanly toggles behaviour at a single decision point
- Where: `LinkUpdater.dry_run` flag; checked in `_update_file_references()`
