## 1. Feature Overview

### Feature Description

The CI/CD & Development Tooling feature encompasses all automation infrastructure for LinkWatcher: the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline, pre-commit hooks, startup/launch scripts, debug tools, benchmarking utilities, and deployment scripts. This is the operational tooling that supports development workflow, code quality enforcement, and deployment readiness.

The GitHub Actions pipeline (`.github/workflows/`) is Windows-only, running 5 jobs: lint (black, isort, flake8, mypy), test (pytest across Python 3.8-3.11), coverage (Codecov reporting), security (dependency scanning), and build (package creation). Non-critical jobs (lint, security) use soft failure (`continue-on-error: true`) to prevent blocking on advisory issues.

Pre-commit hooks (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`) enforce code quality locally before commits, running black, isort, flake8, and mypy. The `dev` CLI tool provides shortcut commands for common development tasks (test, lint, format, dev-setup).

Startup scripts in `LinkWatcher_run/` provide convenient ways to launch LinkWatcher (foreground, background, with logging). Debug tools in `debug/` provide diagnostic capabilities (7+ debug scripts). Benchmark scripts in `scripts/` measure performance. Deployment scripts handle package building and distribution.

### Business Value

- **User Need**: Developers need fast feedback on code quality and automated testing. One-command setup and launch.
- **Business Goal**: Automated quality gates preventing regressions; streamlined development workflow.
- **Success Metrics**: CI pipeline passes on clean commits; pre-commit catches issues before push; startup scripts work reliably on Windows.

### Scope

**In Scope**:

- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline (5 jobs, Windows-only, Python 3.8-3.11)
- Pre-commit hooks (black, isort, flake8, mypy)
- `dev` CLI tool for common development commands
- Startup scripts (PowerShell, batch) in `LinkWatcher_run/`
- Debug tools (7+ scripts in `debug/`)
- Benchmark scripts in `scripts/`
- Deployment scripts
- Example configurations in `examples/`
- Coverage reporting via Codecov

**Out of Scope**:

- Test framework and test code (→ 4.1.1 Test Suite)
- Application code (→ features 0.x.x through 3.x.x)

## 6. Dependencies

### Feature Dependencies

**This Feature Depends On**:

- **[PF-FEA-053: Test Suite](./4.1.1-test-suite-implementation-state.md)** (MAINTAINED)
  - Why: CI pipeline runs the test suite for automated quality gates
  - Impact if unavailable: CI cannot verify code quality

**Other Features Depend On This**:

_No other features depend on CI/CD tooling — it is a supporting infrastructure feature._

### System Dependencies

**Required Packages**:

| Package | Version | Purpose | Added |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ----- |
| black | ≥22.0 | Code formatting | Pre-framework |
| isort | ≥5.0 | Import sorting | Pre-framework |
| flake8 | ≥5.0 | Linting | Pre-framework |
| mypy | ≥0.9 | Type checking | Pre-framework |
| pre-commit | ≥3.0 | Git hook management | Pre-framework |

## 7. Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Windows-Only CI Pipeline

**Date**: Pre-framework (discovered in code)
**Context**: LinkWatcher is a Windows-focused tool; cross-platform CI adds complexity without benefit.

**Decision Made**: GitHub Actions pipeline runs only on `windows-latest`

**Rationale**: The application is developed and deployed on Windows. Linux/macOS CI would catch issues irrelevant to the target platform. Windows-only keeps the pipeline fast and focused.

---

### Decision 2: Soft Failure for Non-Critical Jobs

**Date**: Pre-framework (discovered in code)
**Context**: Some CI jobs (linting, security scanning) are advisory rather than blocking.

**Decision Made**: Non-critical jobs use `continue-on-error: true` to prevent blocking on advisory issues

**Rationale**: Prevents minor lint warnings or advisory security notices from blocking merges. Critical jobs (test, build) still fail the pipeline.

---

### Decision 3: Pre-commit Hooks for Local Quality

**Date**: Pre-framework (discovered in code)
**Context**: Catching issues before they reach CI saves time and reduces failed pipeline runs.

**Decision Made**: Pre-commit hooks running black, isort, flake8, mypy on every commit

**Rationale**: Shifts quality checks left — developers get instant feedback. CI becomes a safety net rather than the primary quality gate.

---

### Decision 4: Multi-Python Version Testing

**Date**: Pre-framework (discovered in code)
**Context**: Users may run different Python versions.

**Decision Made**: Test against Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 in CI matrix

**Rationale**: Ensures compatibility across supported Python versions. Matrix testing catches version-specific issues early.

---

### Implementation Patterns Used

**CI Matrix Pattern**:

- Pattern: GitHub Actions matrix strategy for multi-version testing
- Why: Test across all supported Python versions
- Where: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Pre-commit Pattern**:

- Pattern: Git hooks for automated quality checks
- Why: Catch issues before CI, fast local feedback
- Where: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

## 9. Next Steps

**Last Updated**: 2026-02-21

### Immediate Next Actions

1. **Create test specification**
   - **Why**: No dedicated test spec exists yet
   - **How**: Use Test Specification Creation task
   - **Estimate**: Low (CI/CD testing is implicit in pipeline)
