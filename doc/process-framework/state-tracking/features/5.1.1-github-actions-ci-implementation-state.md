## 1. Feature Overview

### Feature Description

Provides a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` that automates testing, code quality, security scanning, and package building on every push and pull request. The workflow targets `windows-latest` runners exclusively and tests across Python 3.8–3.11 using a matrix strategy.

The pipeline consists of 5 jobs: `test` (matrix test suite with unit/parser/integration tests and Codecov upload), `performance` (performance tests on main branch pushes only, gated behind `test`), `quality` (flake8/black/isort/mypy checks), `security` (safety + bandit scans), and `build` (package build + twine check, gated behind `test` + `quality`). A companion setup script (`scripts/setup_cicd.py`) validates prerequisites and bootstraps the CI environment locally.

### Business Value

- **User Need**: Automated validation that code changes don't break existing functionality
- **Business Goal**: Maintain code quality and reliability across all supported Python versions
- **Success Metrics**: All CI jobs pass on main branch; coverage reports uploaded to Codecov

### Scope

**In Scope**:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — full pipeline definition (5 jobs)
- `scripts/setup_cicd.py` — local CI environment bootstrap script
- `docs/ci-cd.md` — CI/CD documentation
- `CI_CD_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` — implementation summary

**Out of Scope**:

- Pre-commit hook configuration (covered by 5.1.5)
- Package building/publishing details (covered by 5.1.6)
- Test runner logic (covered by 4.1.1)

## 6. Dependencies

### Feature Dependencies

**This Feature Depends On**:

- **[4.1.1 Test Framework](./4.1.1-test-framework-implementation-state.md)**
  - Why: CI test jobs invoke `run_tests.py` which is part of the test framework
  - Status: MAINTAINED
  - Impact if unavailable: CI test execution would fail

- **[5.1.6 Package Building](./5.1.6-package-building-implementation-state.md)**
  - Why: CI build job runs `python -m build` and `twine check`
  - Status: MAINTAINED
  - Impact if unavailable: Package verification step would fail

**Other Features Depend On This**:

- **[5.1.2 Test Automation](./5.1.2-test-automation-implementation-state.md)** (MAINTAINED)
  - Why: Test automation configures which tests run within the CI pipeline
  - Note: Tightly coupled — test automation is defined within the CI workflow

- **[5.1.3 Code Quality Checks](./5.1.3-code-quality-checks-implementation-state.md)** (MAINTAINED)
  - Why: Quality job is defined within the CI workflow
  - Note: Quality tools configured separately in pyproject.toml

- **[5.1.4 Coverage Reporting](./5.1.4-coverage-reporting-implementation-state.md)** (MAINTAINED)
  - Why: Codecov upload step is within the CI test job

## 7. Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Windows-Only CI Pipeline

**Context**: LinkWatcher is a Windows-focused tool; need to decide which platforms to test in CI

**Decision Made**: Run all CI jobs exclusively on `windows-latest` runners

**Rationale**: LinkWatcher uses Windows-specific features (drive letters, UNC paths, case-insensitive matching). Testing on Linux/macOS would require platform abstraction that doesn't reflect actual usage. Windows-only keeps CI simple and relevant.

**Implications**:

- No cross-platform CI overhead
- Contributors on macOS/Linux may see different results locally vs CI
- Future cross-platform support would require adding matrix OS entries

### Decision 2: Soft Failure for Non-Critical Jobs

**Context**: Some CI checks (integration tests, quality, security) may fail without indicating actual regressions

**Decision Made**: Use `continue-on-error: true` for integration tests, quality checks, and security scans

**Rationale**: Strict failure on all jobs would block merges for flake8 warnings or transient integration test issues. Soft failures allow visibility without blocking development. Unit and parser tests remain strict.

**Implications**:

- Quality and security issues are visible but non-blocking
- Integration test flakiness doesn't block merges
- Team must actively monitor soft-failure results

### Decision 3: Gated Pipeline with Job Dependencies

**Context**: Some jobs (performance, build) should only run after prerequisites pass

**Decision Made**: `performance` needs `test`; `build` needs `test` + `quality`. Performance only runs on main-branch pushes.

**Rationale**: Gating prevents wasting CI minutes on builds that will fail anyway. Performance tests are expensive and only needed for main branch validation.

**Implications**:

- PR builds skip performance tests (faster feedback)
- Package build only happens after quality and test verification
