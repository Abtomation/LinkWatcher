## 1. Feature Overview

### Feature Description

Configures static analysis and code quality tooling across the project. The `quality` job in `ci.yml` runs flake8 (linting, max-line-length=100, E203/W503 ignored), black (format checking), isort (import order checking), and mypy (type checking with `--ignore-missing-imports`). All quality checks use `continue-on-error: true` so they report issues without blocking the pipeline.

Tool configuration is centralized in `pyproject.toml`: `[tool.black]` (line-length=100, target Python 3.8–3.11), `[tool.isort]` (profile="black", trailing comma, grid wrap), and `[tool.mypy]` (strict mode: `disallow_untyped_defs`, `warn_return_any`, `strict_equality`, etc.). The `run_tests.py --lint` command provides a local shortcut for running flake8.

### Business Value

- **User Need**: Consistent code style and early detection of type errors
- **Business Goal**: Reduce code review friction; catch bugs before runtime
- **Success Metrics**: All quality checks pass in CI; consistent formatting across codebase

### Scope

**In Scope**:

- CI `quality` job definition in `ci.yml`
- `pyproject.toml` tool configuration sections (`[tool.black]`, `[tool.isort]`, `[tool.mypy]`)
- `run_tests.py --lint` command for local linting

**Out of Scope**:

- Pre-commit hook integration of these tools (covered by 5.1.5)
- Security scanning (separate `security` job within 5.1.1)
- Makefile/dev.bat `lint` and `format` targets (covered by 5.1.7)

## 6. Dependencies

### Feature Dependencies

**This Feature Depends On**:

- **[5.1.1 GitHub Actions CI](./5.1.1-github-actions-ci-implementation-state.md)**
  - Why: Quality job runs within the CI pipeline
  - Status: MAINTAINED
  - Impact if unavailable: Quality checks would only run locally

**Other Features Depend On This**:

- **[5.1.5 Pre-commit Hooks](./5.1.5-pre-commit-hooks-implementation-state.md)** (MAINTAINED)
  - Why: Pre-commit hooks run the same tools (black, isort, flake8) locally before commits
  - Note: Shares tool configuration from pyproject.toml

### System Dependencies

**Required Packages**:

| Package | Version | Purpose | Added |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ----- |
| black | >=23.0.0 | Code formatting | Pre-existing |
| isort | >=5.12.0 | Import sorting | Pre-existing |
| flake8 | >=6.0.0 | Linting | Pre-existing |
| mypy | >=1.0.0 | Type checking | Pre-existing |

### Code Dependencies

**Existing Code This Feature Imports**:

| Component | Used For | Methods/APIs Used | Notes |
| --------- | -------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| [pyproject.toml](../../../../pyproject.toml) | Configuration source for all quality tools | `[tool.black]`, `[tool.isort]`, `[tool.mypy]` | Controls line-length, profiles, strict checks |
| [linkwatcher/](../../../../linkwatcher/) | Target of quality checks | All Python source files | black, isort, flake8, mypy applied to package |
| [tests/](../../../../tests/) | Target of quality checks | All test Python files | black, isort, flake8 applied to tests |

> **Note**: Also uses `flake8` (>=6.0.0), `black` (>=23.0.0), `isort` (>=5.12.0), `mypy` (>=1.0.0) as external quality tools.

## 7. Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Centralized Tool Configuration in pyproject.toml

**Context**: Code quality tools need consistent configuration across CI, pre-commit, and local invocation

**Decision Made**: Configure all tools (black, isort, mypy, coverage) in `pyproject.toml` rather than individual config files (`.black.toml`, `.isort.cfg`, `mypy.ini`)

**Rationale**: Single file reduces configuration sprawl. `pyproject.toml` is the PEP 518/621 standard for Python project configuration. All tools support reading from `pyproject.toml`.

**Implications**:

- One file to maintain for all tool settings
- CI, pre-commit, and local invocation all use the same rules
- Adding new tools only requires a new `[tool.X]` section

### Decision 2: Strict mypy Configuration

**Context**: Type checking strictness level needs to be decided

**Decision Made**: Enable strict mypy mode: `disallow_untyped_defs`, `disallow_incomplete_defs`, `disallow_untyped_decorators`, `no_implicit_optional`, `warn_return_any`, `strict_equality`, etc.

**Rationale**: Strict mode catches more bugs at the cost of requiring type annotations on all functions. Worth the investment for a utility tool where correctness matters.

**Implications**:

- All new functions must have type annotations
- CI quality job uses `--ignore-missing-imports` to handle third-party packages without stubs
- `continue-on-error: true` prevents strict mypy from blocking merges during transition
