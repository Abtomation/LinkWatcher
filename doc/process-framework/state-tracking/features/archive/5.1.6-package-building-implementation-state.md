## 1. Feature Overview

### Feature Description

Configures Python package building and distribution for LinkWatcher. The project uses a dual-configuration approach: `pyproject.toml` (PEP 621 standard — primary) and `setup.py` (legacy compatibility). Both define the same metadata: name=linkwatcher, version=2.0.0, Python >=3.8, runtime dependencies (watchdog, PyYAML, colorama), optional dependency groups (`[test]` and `[dev]`), entry point (`linkwatcher=linkwatcher.cli:main`), and classifiers.

The CI `build` job runs `python -m build` + `twine check dist/*` on push events, gated behind the `test` and `quality` jobs. Deployment scripts (`deployment/install_global.py`, `deployment/setup_project.py`) handle local installation. The `Makefile` provides `clean`, `build`, and `release-check` targets. Supporting files include `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`, and `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Business Value

- **User Need**: Install LinkWatcher as a standard Python package via pip
- **Business Goal**: Distributable package with proper metadata, dependencies, and entry points
- **Success Metrics**: `python -m build` succeeds; `twine check` passes; `pip install -e .` works

### Scope

**In Scope**:

- `pyproject.toml` — build system, project metadata, dependency groups, tool configs
- `setup.py` — legacy setuptools configuration (mirrors pyproject.toml)
- `deployment/install_global.py`, `deployment/setup_project.py` — installation scripts
- `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `MULTI_PROJECT_SETUP.md` — supporting files
- CI `build` job in `ci.yml`

**Out of Scope**:

- CI pipeline structure (covered by 5.1.1)
- Tool configuration sections in pyproject.toml (covered by 5.1.3)
- Makefile/dev.bat build targets (covered by 5.1.7)

## 6. Dependencies

### Feature Dependencies

**This Feature Depends On**:

- **[0.1.1 Core Architecture](./0.1.1-core-architecture-implementation-state.md)**
  - Why: Package builds the linkwatcher package which contains the core architecture
  - Status: MAINTAINED
  - Impact if unavailable: Nothing to package

**Other Features Depend On This**:

- **[5.1.1 GitHub Actions CI](./5.1.1-github-actions-ci-implementation-state.md)** (MAINTAINED)
  - Why: CI build job runs `python -m build` and `twine check`
  - Note: CI validates that the package builds correctly

### System Dependencies

**Required Packages**:

| Package | Version | Purpose | Added |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ----- |
| setuptools | >=61.0 | Build backend | Pre-existing |
| wheel | any | Wheel format support | Pre-existing |
| build | >=0.10.0 | PEP 517 build frontend | Pre-existing |
| twine | >=4.0.0 | Package verification | Pre-existing |

### Code Dependencies

**Existing Code This Feature Imports**:

| Component | Used For | Methods/APIs Used | Notes |
| --------- | -------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| [linkwatcher/](../../../../linkwatcher/) | Source package to build | All Python source files | `[tool.setuptools.packages.find]` discovers these |
| [README.md](../../../../README.md) | Project description in package metadata | `readme = "README.md"` in `[project]` | Displayed on PyPI |
| [requirements.txt](../../../../requirements.txt) | Runtime dependencies | Same deps as `dependencies = [...]` in pyproject.toml | Kept in sync with pyproject.toml |

> **Note**: Also uses `setuptools` (>=61.0), `wheel`, `build` (>=0.10.0), `twine` (>=4.0.0) as external build tools.

**Reverse Code Dependencies** (files that import this feature):

| Component | How They Use This Feature | Methods/APIs Used | Notes |
| --------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| [.github/workflows/ci.yml](../../../../.github/workflows/ci.yml) | "build" job builds and validates package | `python -m build`, `twine check dist/*` | Runs after test and quality jobs |
| [dev.bat](../../../../dev.bat) | `dev build`, `dev install`, `dev install-dev` commands | `python -m build`, `pip install` | Developer build workflow |
| [Makefile](../../../../Makefile) | `build`, `install`, `install-dev`, `release-check` targets | Same as dev.bat | Linux/Mac build workflow |
| [scripts/setup_cicd.py](../../../../scripts/setup_cicd.py) | `validate_configuration()` checks pyproject.toml and setup.py exist | `Path(file_path).exists()` | CI environment validation |

## 7. Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Dual Configuration (pyproject.toml + setup.py)

**Context**: Python packaging supports PEP 621 (pyproject.toml) as the modern standard, but some tools still expect setup.py

**Decision Made**: Maintain both `pyproject.toml` (primary) and `setup.py` (legacy compatibility) with identical metadata

**Rationale**: `pyproject.toml` is the modern standard and supports all PEP 621 metadata. `setup.py` is kept for backwards compatibility with older pip versions and tools that don't support PEP 621. Both define the same version, dependencies, and entry points.

**Implications**:

- Metadata must be kept in sync between both files (duplication risk)
- Supports widest range of installation methods
- Can drop setup.py when minimum pip version is >=21.3

### Decision 2: Optional Dependency Groups

**Context**: Different users need different dependency sets (runtime, testing, development)

**Decision Made**: Define `[test]` and `[dev]` optional dependency groups in both pyproject.toml and setup.py

**Rationale**: Separation allows production installs to skip dev/test dependencies. `pip install -e ".[dev]"` installs everything; `pip install .` installs only runtime deps.

**Implications**:

- Clean production installs without test/dev overhead
- CI can install specific groups as needed
- Dev setup includes all groups via `dev-setup` target
