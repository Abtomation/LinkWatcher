## 1. Feature Overview

### Feature Description

The Generic Parser is the catch-all file reference extractor for any file type not handled by a specialized parser. It uses two compiled regex patterns: `quoted_pattern` matches single- or double-quoted strings that look like file paths; `unquoted_pattern` matches path-like tokens delimited by whitespace. A quoted-first strategy is applied per line: `quoted_pattern` is tried first, and `unquoted_pattern` is only attempted if no quoted match exists on that line. This avoids double-reporting a path that appears both quoted and as a word on the same line.

Unquoted matches undergo secondary validation via `_is_likely_file_reference()`, which checks: path length between 3 and 200 characters, absence of URL scheme indicators and suspicious characters (`@`, `:`, `?`, `&`, `=`, `%`), and presence of either a path separator (`/`, `\`) or a keyword suggesting a file reference. This reduces false positives in generic text files. The two link types (`generic-quoted`, `generic-unquoted`) allow the updater to target replacements precisely.

### Business Value

- **User Need**: Projects use many file formats beyond the specialized parsers; the generic parser ensures no file type is completely untracked
- **Business Goal**: Provide best-effort file reference detection for all file types with an acceptable false-positive rate
- **Success Metrics**: Quoted paths detected in arbitrary file types; unquoted paths validated by secondary heuristic; false-positive rate acceptable in practice

### Scope

**In Scope**:

- `quoted_pattern` for single- and double-quoted file paths
- `unquoted_pattern` with `_is_likely_file_reference()` secondary validation
- Quoted-first per-line strategy
- `generic-quoted` and `generic-unquoted` link types

**Out of Scope**:

- Type-specific structural parsing
- Binary file content
- Multi-line string continuation detection

## 6. Dependencies

### Feature Dependencies

**This Feature Depends On**:

- **[PF-FEA-014: parser-framework](./2.1.1-parser-framework-implementation-state.md)** (MAINTAINED)
  - Why: Inherits from `BaseParser`; uses `_safe_read_file()`, `_looks_like_file_path()`
  - Status: MAINTAINED
  - Impact if unavailable: No base class; parser cannot be instantiated

- **[PF-FEA-005: data-models](./0.1.2-data-models-implementation-state.md)** (MAINTAINED)
  - Why: `LinkReference` is the output type for all extracted references
  - Status: MAINTAINED
  - Impact if unavailable: No output type

**Other Features Depend On This**:

- **[PF-FEA-014: parser-framework](./2.1.1-parser-framework-implementation-state.md)** (MAINTAINED)
  - Why: `GenericParser` is the default fallback registered for all unknown file extensions
  - Note: Also instantiated as error-fallback by yaml-parser and json-parser

- **[PF-FEA-016: yaml-parser](./2.1.3-yaml-parser-implementation-state.md)** (MAINTAINED)
  - Why: Delegates to `GenericParser` when `yaml.safe_load()` raises `YAMLError`

- **[PF-FEA-017: json-parser](./2.1.4-json-parser-implementation-state.md)** (MAINTAINED)
  - Why: Delegates to `GenericParser` when `json.loads()` raises `JSONDecodeError`

## 7. Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Quoted-First Per-Line Detection Strategy

**Date**: 2026-02-18 (discovered)
**Context**: Generic text files may contain the same path both quoted (in a string literal) and unquoted (as a bare word). Applying both patterns independently would record the same reference twice.

**Options Considered**:

1. Apply both patterns independently; deduplicate by position: Post-processing overhead; more complex logic
2. Quoted-first guard per line (chosen): Try `quoted_pattern` first; only try `unquoted_pattern` if no quoted match found on that line
3. Apply only quoted pattern: Misses paths in files where paths are not quoted (e.g., some config formats)

**Decision Made**: Quoted-first per-line strategy (Option 2)

**Rationale**: Quoted paths are higher-confidence references. The guard prevents double-reporting a path that appears both quoted and unquoted on the same line. Simple implementation with no post-processing needed.

**Implications**:

- A line with both a quoted path and a different unquoted path will only report the quoted one
- Acceptable precision trade-off for a best-effort fallback parser

---

### Decision 2: Secondary _is_likely_file_reference() Validation for Unquoted Paths

**Date**: 2026-02-18 (discovered)
**Context**: The `unquoted_pattern` matches any word-like token, producing many false positives in generic text files (natural language words, IDs, values).

**Options Considered**:

1. Accept all unquoted matches: Too many false positives in prose text files
2. Secondary validation with heuristic checks (chosen): Filter by length, absence of URL indicators, presence of path separator or file keyword
3. Require path separator in all unquoted paths: Too strict; misses `filename.ext` style references

**Decision Made**: `_is_likely_file_reference()` secondary check on all unquoted matches (Option 2)

**Rationale**: Reduces false positives significantly. Length bounds (3–200 chars), URL indicator exclusion (`@`, `:`, `?`, `&`, `=`, `%`), and path separator or keyword presence are practical heuristics with acceptable false-negative rate.

---

### Decision 3: Two Distinct Link Types (generic-quoted, generic-unquoted)

**Date**: 2026-02-18 (discovered)
**Context**: The updater needs to locate and replace the exact text of a detected link. Quoted and unquoted paths require different replacement strategies (with or without surrounding quotes).

**Options Considered**:

1. Single `generic` link_type for all matches: Updater cannot distinguish replacement strategy
2. Two distinct link_type values (chosen): `generic-quoted` and `generic-unquoted` enable targeted replacement
3. Store quote character in LinkReference metadata: More flexible but complicates the data model

**Decision Made**: Two link_type values: `generic-quoted` and `generic-unquoted` (Option 2)

**Rationale**: Consistent with other parsers (dart-import, dart-part, etc.) that use distinct link_type values per pattern. Enables precise replacement without corrupting surrounding content.

---

### Implementation Patterns Used

**Structural Pattern**:

- Pattern: Template Method (via `BaseParser`)
- Why: Common file-read infrastructure in base; generic detection logic in `GenericParser`
- Where: `BaseParser._safe_read_file()`; per-line detection in `GenericParser`

**Guard Pattern**:

- Pattern: Guard clause (quoted-first guard)
- Why: Prevents double-reporting when a path appears both quoted and unquoted on the same line
- Where: Per-line conditional in extraction loop
