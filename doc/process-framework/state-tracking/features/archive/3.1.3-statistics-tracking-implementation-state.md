## 1. Feature Overview

### Feature Description

Collects and tracks logging operation metrics across the system. The `LogMetrics` class in `logging_config.py` maintains thread-safe counters for total logs, per-level counts, per-component/operation breakdowns, and error/warning tallies. Computed metrics like `logs_per_minute` and `uptime` are derived on-demand via `get_metrics()`.

Additionally, `PerformanceLogger` in `logging.py` provides operation-level timing metrics via `start_timer()`/`end_timer()` and arbitrary metric logging via `log_metric()`. The `operation_stats()` convenience method on `LinkWatcherLogger` provides a domain-specific entry point for logging summary statistics.

### Business Value

- **User Need**: Understand system health and throughput — how many files processed, how many errors occurred, operation durations
- **Business Goal**: Enable data-driven monitoring and capacity planning for large projects
- **Success Metrics**: Accurate per-level and per-component counts; metrics accessible at runtime via API

### Scope

**In Scope**:

- Thread-safe log event counting (`LogMetrics` with `threading.Lock`)
- Per-level, per-component, per-operation breakdown counters
- Computed derived metrics (uptime, logs_per_minute)
- Performance timer tracking via `PerformanceLogger`
- Metrics reset capability
- Debug snapshot generation including metrics + active filters

**Out of Scope**:

- Persistent metrics storage (in-memory only)
- External metrics export (Prometheus, StatsD, etc.)

## 6. Dependencies

### Feature Dependencies

**This Feature Depends On**:

- **[3.1.1 Logging Framework](./3.1.1-logging-framework-implementation-state.md)**
  - Why: `LogMetrics` is used by `LoggingConfigManager` which depends on `get_logger()`; `PerformanceLogger` uses structlog
  - Status: COMPLETE
  - Impact if unavailable: No metrics collection or performance timing

**Other Features Depend On This**:

- No direct dependents — metrics are consumed via `LoggingConfigManager.get_metrics()` and `create_debug_snapshot()`

### System Dependencies

**Required Packages**:

| Package | Version | Purpose | Added |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ----- |
| structlog | >=21.0 | `PerformanceLogger` logs metrics via structlog | Pre-existing |

### Code Dependencies

**Existing Code This Feature Imports**:

| Component | Used For | Methods/APIs Used | Notes |
| --------- | -------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| [linkwatcher/logging.py](../../../../linkwatcher/logging.py) | Logging infrastructure | `get_logger()`, logging methods | Output statistics |
| [linkwatcher/config/settings.py](../../../../linkwatcher/config/settings.py) | Configuration | `LinkWatcherConfig`, `show_statistics` flag | Statistics enabled |

> **Note**: Also uses `threading.Lock` (stdlib, thread-safe counters), `datetime` (stdlib, uptime tracking), `time` (stdlib, `time.time()` for durations), `structlog` (external, `PerformanceLogger` metrics).

**Reverse Code Dependencies** (files that import this feature):

| Component | How They Use This Feature | Methods/APIs Used | Notes |
| --------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| This feature is implemented in `linkwatcher/service.py` and `linkwatcher/logging_config.py`. Metrics are consumed via `LoggingConfigManager.get_metrics()` and `create_debug_snapshot()`. Reverse dependencies of [core-architecture (0.1.1)](./0.1.1-core-architecture-implementation-state.md) also consume this feature indirectly. | | | |

## 7. Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Thread-Safe Metrics with Single Lock

**Context**: Logging happens across multiple threads (file watcher, main, config watcher).

**Decision Made**: Single `threading.Lock` protecting all metric operations.

**Rationale**: Simple and correct. Lock contention is minimal because metric recording is fast (dict get/set). A single lock avoids deadlock risks from multiple locks.

**Implications**:
- All metric operations are serialized — but each operation is O(1) so contention is negligible
- Lock must be held for both reads and writes to ensure consistency

### Decision 2: Computed Metrics on Read (Not Stored)

**Context**: Need derived metrics like `logs_per_minute` and `uptime`.

**Decision Made**: Compute `uptime` and `logs_per_minute` in `get_metrics()` rather than storing and updating them.

**Rationale**: Always accurate — no stale data. Computing from `start_time` and `total_logs` is trivial. Avoids maintaining additional counters or timers.

### Decision 3: Dict-Based Counter Accumulation

**Context**: Need to count logs by level, component, and operation — all with dynamic keys.

**Decision Made**: `dict.get(key, 0) + 1` pattern for accumulation.

**Rationale**: Simple, handles unknown keys without KeyError, no `defaultdict` import needed. Dynamic keys mean any component or operation name is tracked automatically.

---

### Implementation Patterns Used

**Accumulator Pattern**:
- Pattern: `dict.get(key, 0) + 1` for dynamic counter accumulation
- Why: Safe for unknown keys, no setup needed per category
- Where: `record_log()` for level/component/operation counters

**Snapshot Pattern**:
- Pattern: `metrics.copy()` in `get_metrics()` returns a snapshot
- Why: Callers get a stable copy that won't mutate during processing
- Where: `get_metrics()`, `create_debug_snapshot()`
