## 1. Feature Overview

### Feature Description

Provides the CI-level test automation configuration that orchestrates test execution in the GitHub Actions pipeline. Within `ci.yml`, the `test` job runs `run_tests.py` with `--discover`, `--unit --coverage`, `--parsers`, and `--integration` flags sequentially across a Python version matrix. The `performance` job runs `run_tests.py --performance` on main-branch pushes only, gated behind the `test` job.

This feature bridges the test framework (4.1.1) and the CI pipeline (5.1.1) — it defines which test categories run in CI, their execution order, failure tolerance (`continue-on-error: true` for integration and performance tests), and artifact collection for performance results. The `scripts/__init__.py` marks the scripts directory as a Python package for import support.

### Business Value

- **User Need**: Tests run automatically on every push/PR without manual intervention
- **Business Goal**: Catch regressions before merging; ensure multi-version compatibility
- **Success Metrics**: All CI test steps complete (with allowed soft failures for integration/performance)

### Scope

**In Scope**:

- CI workflow test job steps (unit, parser, integration test execution)
- CI workflow performance job (gated, main-branch-only)
- `scripts/__init__.py` — scripts package init
- Test result artifact upload configuration

**Out of Scope**:

- Test framework infrastructure (covered by 4.1.1)
- Individual test implementations (covered by 4.1.2–4.1.5)
- CI pipeline infrastructure (covered by 5.1.1)

## 6. Dependencies

### Feature Dependencies

**This Feature Depends On**:

- **[5.1.1 GitHub Actions CI](./5.1.1-github-actions-ci-implementation-state.md)**
  - Why: Test automation is defined within the CI workflow
  - Status: MAINTAINED
  - Impact if unavailable: No pipeline to run tests in

- **[4.1.1 Test Framework](./4.1.1-test-framework-implementation-state.md)**
  - Why: CI invokes `run_tests.py` which orchestrates pytest
  - Status: MAINTAINED
  - Impact if unavailable: Test commands would fail

## 7. Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Sequential Test Category Execution in CI

**Context**: CI needs to run multiple test categories (unit, parser, integration, performance)

**Decision Made**: Run test categories sequentially within a single job rather than as parallel jobs

**Rationale**: Sequential execution in a single job avoids repeated dependency installation overhead. Categories are ordered by reliability: discover → unit → parsers → integration, so the most stable tests run first and provide early feedback.

**Implications**:

- Slower total CI time but lower resource usage
- Clear failure identification (which category failed)
- Integration tests use `continue-on-error: true` for resilience

### Decision 2: Performance Tests Gated Behind Main Branch

**Context**: Performance tests are slow and expensive; not needed on every PR

**Decision Made**: Performance job only runs on `push` to `main` (`if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'`), gated behind the test job

**Rationale**: PR feedback should be fast. Performance regressions are caught on merge to main rather than blocking PR workflows.

**Implications**:

- PRs get faster feedback (no performance test wait)
- Performance regressions detected post-merge
- Performance results uploaded as artifacts for trend analysis
