## 1. Feature Overview

### Feature Description

Provides performance and scalability tests that verify LinkWatcher handles large projects efficiently. The `tests/performance/test_large_projects.py` implements the PH test cases (PH-001 through PH-005): 1000+ files with links, deep directory structures, large files, many references to a single file, and rapid file operations.

Tests are marked with `@pytest.mark.slow` and excluded from normal test runs (`run_all_tests` uses `-m "not slow"`). The `performance` environment config disables backups and uses WARNING log level for minimal overhead. The `tests/test_config.py` defines size tiers (small: 50 files, medium: 200, large: 1000, xlarge: 5000) with configurable `files_per_dir` and `refs_per_file` ratios. The `tests/utils.py` provides `create_large_project()` for generating test structures and `PerformanceTimer` for timing.

### Business Value

- **User Need**: Confidence that LinkWatcher remains responsive on real-world projects with 1000+ files
- **Business Goal**: Identify performance regressions before they affect users; validate sub-second response claims
- **Success Metrics**: 5+ performance test methods; 1000-file scan completes within acceptable timeframes

### Scope

**In Scope**:

- PH-001: 1000+ files with cross-references
- PH-002: Deep directory structures (many nesting levels)
- PH-003: Large individual files
- PH-004: Many references to single file (fan-in)
- PH-005: Rapid file operations (throughput)

**Out of Scope**:

- Memory profiling (no explicit memory measurement tests)
- Continuous benchmarking CI integration

## 6. Dependencies

### Feature Dependencies

**This Feature Depends On**:

- **[4.1.1 Test Framework](./4.1.1-test-framework-implementation-state.md)**
  - Why: Uses `temp_project_dir` fixture for test environments
  - Status: COMPLETE
  - Impact if unavailable: Cannot create temporary test structures
- **[4.1.7 Test Utilities](./4.1.7-test-utilities-implementation-state.md)**
  - Why: Uses `create_large_project()`, `PerformanceTimer` from utils.py
  - Status: COMPLETE
  - Impact if unavailable: Would need to manually create large test structures

**Other Features Depend On This**:

- No direct dependents — performance tests are a validation endpoint

### System Dependencies

**Required Packages**:

| Package | Version | Purpose | Added |

| Component | How They Use This Feature | Methods/APIs Used | Notes |
| --------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| [run_tests.py](../../../../run_tests.py) | Executes performance tests | `run_performance_tests()` invokes pytest with `-m slow` | Runs tests marked as slow |
| [scripts/benchmark.py](../../../../scripts/benchmark.py) | Performance benchmarking tool | Similar testing patterns | Standalone benchmarking script |
| CI/CD pipelines (`.github/workflows/*.yml`) | Optional performance testing | pytest command with performance markers | Typically excluded from regular CI |

## 7. Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Slow Marker for Exclusion

**Context**: Performance tests take significantly longer than other tests (minutes vs. seconds).

**Decision Made**: Mark all performance tests with `@pytest.mark.slow`. Default `run_all_tests` uses `-m "not slow"`.

**Rationale**: Prevents performance tests from slowing down normal development workflow. Developers explicitly opt in with `--performance`. CI can run them on a schedule rather than every push.

### Decision 2: Configurable Size Tiers

**Context**: Performance tests need to run at different scales for different purposes.

**Decision Made**: 4 size tiers (small: 50, medium: 200, large: 1000, xlarge: 5000 files) in `test_config.py`.

**Rationale**: Small tier for quick smoke tests. Large tier for realistic validation. XLarge for stress testing. Each tier has appropriate `files_per_dir` and `refs_per_file` ratios for realistic cross-referencing.

### Decision 3: Time-Based Assertions

**Context**: Performance tests need to verify acceptable execution times.

**Decision Made**: Use `time.time()` for wall-clock timing with explicit assertions on duration.

**Rationale**: Simple and portable. No external benchmarking framework needed. Wall-clock time matches user experience. `PerformanceTimer` context manager provides clean timing syntax.

---

### Implementation Patterns Used

**Scale Testing Pattern**:
- Pattern: Generate N files with M cross-references, time the operation
- Why: Reproducible load generation with configurable scale
- Where: `create_large_project()` generates structures; tests time scan operations

**Marker-Based Exclusion Pattern**:
- Pattern: `@pytest.mark.slow` + `-m "not slow"` in default run
- Why: Opt-in execution for expensive tests
- Where: All performance test methods
