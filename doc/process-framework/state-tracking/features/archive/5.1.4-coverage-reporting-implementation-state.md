## 1. Feature Overview

### Feature Description

Configures code coverage measurement and reporting for the LinkWatcher test suite. Coverage is collected via `pytest-cov` (wrapping `coverage.py`) and configured in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.coverage.run]` and `[tool.coverage.report]`. The source is limited to the `linkwatcher` package, with tests, test files, and `setup.py` explicitly omitted.

In CI, coverage is uploaded to Codecov via `codecov/codecov-action@v3` on the Python 3.11 matrix slot only (`if: matrix.python-version == '3.11'`). Locally, `run_tests.py --coverage` generates an HTML coverage report in `htmlcov/`. The `[tool.coverage.report]` section defines exclusion patterns for lines that shouldn't count (e.g., `pragma: no cover`, `__repr__`, abstract methods, Protocol definitions).

### Business Value

- **User Need**: Visibility into which code paths are exercised by tests
- **Business Goal**: Identify untested code; prevent coverage regression
- **Success Metrics**: Coverage percentage reported on every PR via Codecov badge

### Scope

**In Scope**:

- `pyproject.toml` `[tool.coverage.run]` and `[tool.coverage.report]` configuration
- CI Codecov upload step in `ci.yml`
- `run_tests.py --coverage` local HTML report generation

**Out of Scope**:

- Test implementation details (covered by 4.1.2–4.1.5)
- CI pipeline structure (covered by 5.1.1)

## 6. Dependencies

### Feature Dependencies

**This Feature Depends On**:

- **[5.1.1 GitHub Actions CI](./5.1.1-github-actions-ci-implementation-state.md)**
  - Why: Codecov upload step lives in the CI test job
  - Status: MAINTAINED
  - Impact if unavailable: Coverage would only be available locally

- **[4.1.1 Test Framework](./4.1.1-test-framework-implementation-state.md)**
  - Why: Coverage collection happens during pytest execution via pytest-cov
  - Status: MAINTAINED
  - Impact if unavailable: No tests to measure coverage for

**Other Features Depend On This**:

- None (coverage reporting is a terminal consumer)

### System Dependencies

**Required Services**:

- Codecov: External coverage reporting and tracking service

**Required Packages**:

| Package | Version | Purpose | Added |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ----- |
| pytest-cov | >=4.0.0 | Coverage collection during tests | Pre-existing |
| coverage | >=7.0.0 | Coverage measurement engine | Pre-existing |
| codecov/codecov-action | v3 | CI upload to Codecov | Pre-existing |

### Code Dependencies

**Existing Code This Feature Imports**:

| Component | Used For | Methods/APIs Used | Notes |
| --------- | -------- | ----------------- | ----- |

## 7. Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Single-Version Codecov Upload

**Context**: CI matrix tests across Python 3.8–3.11; need to decide which version uploads coverage

**Decision Made**: Upload coverage only from the Python 3.11 matrix slot (`if: matrix.python-version == '3.11'`)

**Rationale**: Coverage percentages should be identical across Python versions (same code paths). Uploading from all 4 versions would create redundant reports. Using the latest supported version ensures the most relevant coverage data.

**Implications**:

- Single coverage report per CI run
- Coverage reflects Python 3.11 behavior (minor branch differences in older versions are not tracked)
- `fail_ci_if_error: false` prevents Codecov outages from blocking CI

### Decision 2: Comprehensive Exclusion Patterns

**Context**: Some code lines can never be covered by tests (abstract methods, debug guards, Protocol definitions)

**Decision Made**: Define 10 exclusion patterns in `[tool.coverage.report].exclude_lines` including `pragma: no cover`, `__repr__`, `NotImplementedError`, `if __name__`, Protocol definitions, and abstract methods

**Rationale**: Excluding uncoverable lines gives a more accurate coverage percentage that reflects actual test effectiveness. Prevents false low-coverage alerts on inherently untestable code.

**Implications**:

- Coverage percentage better reflects actual test quality
- New uncoverable patterns should be added to the exclusion list
- Developers can use `# pragma: no cover` for legitimate exclusions
