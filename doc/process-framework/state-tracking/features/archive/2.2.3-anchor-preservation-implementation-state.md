## 1. Feature Overview

### Feature Description

Anchor preservation is implemented inside `_calculate_new_target()` in `LinkUpdater`. When a link target is processed for updating, the method first checks whether the target contains a `#` character. If found, the target is split on the first `#` into a path component (before the `#`) and an anchor fragment (after the `#`). Only the path component is passed to `_calculate_new_target_relative()` for path recalculation. After the new path is computed, the anchor fragment is recombined: `f"{new_path}#{anchor}"`. This ensures that section links like `doc/guide.md#installation` remain valid after the referenced file moves to a new location.

If the link target contains no `#`, the full target is passed directly to `_calculate_new_target_relative()` without splitting. Anchor fragments are preserved exactly as found — no encoding, normalization, or validation is applied — and recombined with `#` as the separator.

### Business Value

- **User Need**: Documents frequently link to specific sections within other files; the anchor fragment must survive the path update unchanged
- **Business Goal**: Ensure section links remain functional after path recalculation by preserving the fragment identifier exactly
- **Success Metrics**: `#fragment` portions preserved exactly; path-only links processed without modification; recombined links point to correct section in new location

### Scope

**In Scope**:

- `#` detection and split logic in `_calculate_new_target()`
- Anchor fragment pass-through (no modification)
- Path/anchor recombination with `#` separator

**Out of Scope**:

- Anchor validation (checking that the target section heading exists)
- Anchor renaming on section heading changes
- URL fragment encoding/decoding

## 6. Dependencies

### Feature Dependencies

**This Feature Depends On**:

- **[PF-FEA-021: link-updater](./2.2.1-link-updater-implementation-state.md)** (MAINTAINED)
  - Why: Implemented as logic within `_calculate_new_target()` in `LinkUpdater`; no standalone existence
  - Status: MAINTAINED
  - Impact if unavailable: Anchor preservation is integral to link-updater; cannot be separated

- **[PF-FEA-005: data-models](./0.1.2-data-models-implementation-state.md)** (MAINTAINED)
  - Why: `LinkReference.link_target` is the string on which anchor splitting is performed
  - Status: MAINTAINED
  - Impact if unavailable: No input data type

**Other Features Depend On This**:

- **Note**: This feature is implemented inside [link-updater (PF-FEA-021)](./2.2.1-link-updater-implementation-state.md). All reverse dependencies of link-updater also consume this feature indirectly. See [2.2.1-link-updater-implementation-state.md](./2.2.1-link-updater-implementation-state.md) for the full reverse dependency list.

### System Dependencies

**Required Services**:

_None_

**Required Packages**:

_None — implemented using Python built-in string methods only_

### Code Dependencies

**Existing Code This Feature Imports**:

| Component | Used For | Methods/APIs Used | Notes |
| --------- | -------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| [linkwatcher/updater.py](../../../../linkwatcher/updater.py) | Implementation location | `_calculate_new_target()` method | Anchor logic is inline in this method |
| [linkwatcher/models.py](../../../../linkwatcher/models.py) | Input data | `LinkReference.link_target` | Access link target for anchor extraction |

> **Note**: Uses Python built-in string methods only (`split('#', 1)`, f-string concatenation). No additional imports.

**Reverse Code Dependencies** (files that import this feature):

| Component | How They Use This Feature | Methods/APIs Used | Notes |
| --------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| This feature is implemented as anchor handling within `_calculate_new_target()` in `linkwatcher/updater.py`. All reverse dependencies of [link-updater (2.2.1)](./2.2.1-link-updater-implementation-state.md) also consume this feature indirectly. | | | |

## 7. Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Split on First '#' Only (split('#', 1))

**Date**: 2026-02-18 (discovered)
**Context**: Link targets may contain both a path and an anchor fragment (e.g., `doc/guide.md#installation`). The `#` separator must be found reliably even when the anchor text itself contains `#` (e.g., Markdown heading `## Section` produces anchor `#-section` in some renderers).

**Options Considered**:

1. Split on all `#` characters (rsplit or split without limit): Incorrectly handles anchors containing `#`
2. Split on first `#` only — `split('#', 1)` (chosen): Produces exactly two parts: path and everything after the first `#`
3. Regex extraction: Unnecessary complexity; `split('#', 1)` is idiomatic Python

**Decision Made**: `target.split('#', 1)` to split into `[path, anchor]` (Option 2)

**Rationale**: Splits exactly once at the first `#`. The anchor portion is preserved exactly as found, regardless of whether it contains further `#` characters. Idiomatic; no regex needed.

**Implications**:

- A target with no `#` returns a single-element list — handled by `len(parts) == 1` check
- Anchor content is never parsed or validated

---

### Decision 2: Anchor Fragment Pass-Through Without Modification

**Date**: 2026-02-18 (discovered)
**Context**: Anchor fragments reference specific headings within the target document. The heading text does not change when the file moves to a new location; only the file path changes.

**Options Considered**:

1. Normalize anchor to standard form (lowercase, hyphenate spaces): Different markdown renderers produce different anchors; normalization would break cross-renderer links
2. Pass anchor through unchanged (chosen): Recombine with new path as `f"{new_path}#{anchor}"`
3. Validate anchor exists in target file: Too expensive; requires parsing the target file at update time

**Decision Made**: Recombine anchor fragment unchanged: `f"{new_path}#{anchor}"` (Option 2)

**Rationale**: The anchor refers to a heading within the file, which is unaffected by the file moving. Normalization would risk breaking links that work correctly. Pass-through is the minimal correct behaviour.

---

### Implementation Patterns Used

**Wrapping Pattern**:

- Pattern: Decorator-like wrap (extract anchor → process path → reattach anchor)
- Why: Anchor handling is orthogonal to path calculation; wrapping keeps each concern separate
- Where: `_calculate_new_target()` in `LinkUpdater`
