## 1. Feature Overview

### Feature Description

Relative path calculation is implemented inside `LinkUpdater` as `_calculate_new_target_relative()` and its helper methods. When a link target must be updated after a file move, this feature determines the correct new path using a 4-level matching strategy: (1) direct match against the old path, (2) slash-stripped match (comparing with leading slash removed), (3) source-relative match (resolving the original link relative to the source file), (4) filename-only match (matching by basename alone as a last resort).

Three helper methods support the calculation: `_analyze_link_type()` classifies the original link as absolute, relative-explicit (starts with `./` or `../`), or filename-only; `_resolve_to_absolute_path()` converts any link form to an absolute path for matching against the moved file; `_convert_to_original_link_type()` converts the computed absolute new path back to the original link style (e.g., relative if the link was relative). The final relative path between files is computed using `os.path.relpath()`, and path separator style is preserved from the original link.

### Business Value

- **User Need**: Updated links must be valid relative paths from the containing document to the moved file, not just absolute paths
- **Business Goal**: Compute the exact new path string that preserves the original link style while pointing to the file's new location
- **Success Metrics**: Updated links are valid relative paths; original separator style preserved; all 4 matching levels handle edge cases

### Scope

**In Scope**:

- 4-level path matching strategy (direct, slash-stripped, source-relative, filename-only)
- `_analyze_link_type()` for link style classification
- `_resolve_to_absolute_path()` for absolute path resolution
- `_convert_to_original_link_type()` for style preservation
- `_calculate_relative_path_between_files()` using `os.path.relpath()`
- Path separator style preservation

**Out of Scope**:

- Cross-drive relative paths (Windows limitation)
- UNC path handling
- URL encoding/decoding

## 6. Dependencies

### Feature Dependencies

**This Feature Depends On**:

- **[PF-FEA-021: link-updater](./2.2.1-link-updater-implementation-state.md)** (MAINTAINED)
  - Why: Implemented as private methods within `LinkUpdater`; has no standalone existence
  - Status: MAINTAINED
  - Impact if unavailable: Path calculation is an integral part of link-updater; they cannot be separated

- **[PF-FEA-005: data-models](./0.1.2-data-models-implementation-state.md)** (MAINTAINED)
  - Why: `LinkReference.link_target` is the input string that path calculation operates on
  - Status: MAINTAINED
  - Impact if unavailable: No input data type

**Other Features Depend On This**:

- **Note**: This feature is implemented inside [link-updater (PF-FEA-021)](./2.2.1-link-updater-implementation-state.md). All reverse dependencies of link-updater also consume this feature indirectly. See [2.2.1-link-updater-implementation-state.md](./2.2.1-link-updater-implementation-state.md) for the full reverse dependency list.

### System Dependencies

**Required Services**:

_None_

**Required Packages**:

_None beyond Python standard library (`os`, `pathlib`)_

### Code Dependencies

**Existing Code This Feature Imports**:

| Component | Used For | Methods/APIs Used | Notes |
| --------- | -------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| [linkwatcher/models.py](../../../../linkwatcher/models.py) | Input data | `LinkReference.link_target` | Source link string to recalculate |

> **Note**: Also uses `os.path` (stdlib, `isabs()`, `join()`, `relpath()`) and `pathlib` (stdlib, `Path`, `resolve()`, `relative_to()`) for path operations.

**Reverse Code Dependencies** (files that import this feature):

| Component | How They Use This Feature | Methods/APIs Used | Notes |
| --------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| This feature is implemented as `_calculate_new_target()` within `linkwatcher/updater.py`. All reverse dependencies of [link-updater (2.2.1)](./2.2.1-link-updater-implementation-state.md) also consume this feature indirectly. | | | |

## 7. Design Decisions

### Decision 1: 4-Level Path Matching Strategy

**Date**: 2026-02-18 (discovered)
**Context**: Link targets in documents are stored in many forms (absolute path, relative path with `./`, relative without prefix, filename-only). To determine whether a given link refers to the moved file, a flexible matching strategy is needed that handles all practical forms.

**Options Considered**:

1. Exact string match only: Misses all non-canonical path forms
2. Normalize all paths to absolute before comparison: Requires knowing the source file's location, which may not always be available
3. 4-level fallback strategy (chosen): Direct → slash-stripped → source-relative → filename-only; each level widens matching

**Decision Made**: 4-level matching: (1) direct match against old path, (2) slash-stripped match, (3) resolve relative to source file and compare, (4) filename-only as last resort (Option 3)

**Rationale**: Each level catches a different class of link storage format. Ordered from most specific to least specific to minimize false positives. Filename-only is last resort only.

**Implications**:

- Filename-only matching (level 4) risks false positives if multiple files share the same name in different directories
- Each level adds a fallback but does not re-check already-resolved matches

---

### Decision 2: Link Style Classification and Preservation

**Date**: 2026-02-18 (discovered)
**Context**: After computing the new path, it must be expressed in the same style as the original link (absolute, relative with `./`/`../`, or filename-only). Changing the style would confuse users and might break other tooling.

**Options Considered**:

1. Always output absolute paths: Simple but breaks relative links; users expect style preservation
2. Always output relative paths: Breaks absolute links in documents designed to use them
3. Classify original style; convert computed path back to original style (chosen): `_analyze_link_type()` → compute → `_convert_to_original_link_type()`

**Decision Made**: Classify original link as absolute/relative-explicit/filename-only; compute new absolute path; convert back to original style (Option 3)

**Rationale**: Users expect updated links to look the same as original links. Style preservation avoids surprising format changes across the codebase.

---

### Decision 3: os.path.relpath() for Final Relative Path Calculation

**Date**: 2026-02-18 (discovered)
**Context**: After computing the new absolute target path, a relative path from the source document's directory to the target must be computed.

**Options Considered**:

1. Manual path arithmetic (count `../` steps): Error-prone; platform-specific edge cases
2. `os.path.relpath(target, start)` (chosen): Standard library; handles all edge cases correctly
3. `pathlib.Path.relative_to()`: Only works when target is a subpath of start; fails for paths requiring `../`

**Decision Made**: `os.path.relpath(new_target_abs, source_dir)` (Option 2)

**Rationale**: stdlib reliability. Handles all `../` traversal cases. Works on both Windows and POSIX within the same OS. Simpler than manual arithmetic.

**Implications**:

- Cross-drive relative paths are not supported on Windows (os.path.relpath raises ValueError)
- The Windows limitation is documented as out-of-scope

---

### Implementation Patterns Used

**Matching Pattern**:

- Pattern: Chain of Responsibility (4-level fallback)
- Why: Each level handles a different path form; first match wins
- Where: `_calculate_new_target_relative()` matching logic

**Style Preservation Pattern**:

- Pattern: Classify → Transform → Convert Back
- Why: Input style must be preserved in output; intermediate computation uses absolute paths
- Where: `_analyze_link_type()` → path calculation → `_convert_to_original_link_type()`
