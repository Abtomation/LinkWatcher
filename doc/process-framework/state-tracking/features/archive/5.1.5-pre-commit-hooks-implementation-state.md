## 1. Feature Overview

### Feature Description

Defines pre-commit hook configuration in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` that runs code quality checks automatically before each commit. The configuration includes 4 hook repositories: `pre-commit-hooks` (v4.4.0 — trailing whitespace, end-of-file fixer, YAML/JSON validation, merge conflict detection, large file check, debug statement detection), `black` (v23.7.0 — code formatting with `--line-length=100`), `isort` (v5.12.0 — import sorting with `--profile=black`), and `flake8` (v6.0.0 — linting with `--max-line-length=100`).

Additionally, a local `pytest-quick` hook runs `python run_tests.py --quick` at the `commit` stage with `always_run: true`, ensuring quick tests pass before any commit is accepted. Installation is done via `pre-commit install` and `pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg`, automated through `scripts/setup_cicd.py` and Makefile/dev.bat `pre-commit` targets.

### Business Value

- **User Need**: Catch formatting, linting, and test failures before they enter version control
- **Business Goal**: Shift quality checks left; reduce CI failures from preventable issues
- **Success Metrics**: All hooks pass before commits; no formatting or import order issues in PRs

### Scope

**In Scope**:

- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` — hook definitions (4 external repos + 1 local)
- Pre-commit installation via setup scripts (Makefile, dev.bat, setup_cicd.py)

**Out of Scope**:

- CI-level quality checks (covered by 5.1.3)
- Tool configuration details in pyproject.toml (covered by 5.1.3)

## 6. Dependencies

### Feature Dependencies

**This Feature Depends On**:

- **[5.1.3 Code Quality Checks](./5.1.3-code-quality-checks-implementation-state.md)**
  - Why: Pre-commit hooks run black, isort, flake8 — same tools configured by code quality
  - Status: MAINTAINED
  - Impact if unavailable: Hook configuration would need to duplicate tool settings

- **[4.1.1 Test Framework](./4.1.1-test-framework-implementation-state.md)**
  - Why: Local `pytest-quick` hook invokes `run_tests.py --quick`
  - Status: MAINTAINED
  - Impact if unavailable: Pre-commit test hook would fail

**Other Features Depend On This**:

- None (pre-commit is a developer-workflow feature with no downstream consumers)

### System Dependencies

**Required Packages**:

| Package | Version | Purpose | Added |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ----- |
| pre-commit | >=3.0.0 | Hook management framework | Pre-existing |
| pre-commit-hooks | v4.4.0 | Standard file quality hooks | Pre-existing |
| black | v23.7.0 | Code formatting hook | Pre-existing |
| isort | v5.12.0 | Import sorting hook | Pre-existing |
| flake8 | v6.0.0 | Linting hook | Pre-existing |

### Code Dependencies

**Existing Code This Feature Imports**:

| Component | Used For | Methods/APIs Used | Notes |
| --------- | -------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| [run_tests.py](../../../../run_tests.py) | Quick test execution on commit | `python run_tests.py --quick` | Local `pytest-quick` hook |
| [pyproject.toml](../../../../pyproject.toml) | Configuration for black and isort hooks | `[tool.black]` and `[tool.isort]` settings | Hook tools read config from pyproject.toml |

> **Note**: Also uses `pre-commit` (>=3.0.0, external framework), `black` (v23.7.0), `isort` (v5.12.0), `flake8` (v6.0.0), `pre-commit-hooks` (v4.4.0) as external hook packages.

**Reverse Code Dependencies** (files that import this feature):

| Component | How They Use This Feature | Methods/APIs Used | Notes |
| --------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| [dev.bat](../../../../dev.bat) | `dev pre-commit` installs hooks; `dev dev-setup` calls it | `python -m pre_commit install` | Developer setup workflow |
| [Makefile](../../../../Makefile) | `pre-commit` target installs hooks | `pre-commit install` | Linux/Mac setup workflow |
| [scripts/setup_cicd.py](../../../../scripts/setup_cicd.py) | `setup_pre_commit()` function installs hooks | `pre-commit install` | CI/CD environment setup |
| Git commit process | Hooks run automatically on every `git commit` | All hooks in .pre-commit-config.yaml | Enforced automatically |

## 7. Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Local Test Hook at Commit Stage

**Context**: Pre-commit hooks typically run formatting/linting only; should tests also run before commit?

**Decision Made**: Include a local `pytest-quick` hook that runs `python run_tests.py --quick` with `always_run: true` at the `commit` stage

**Rationale**: Quick tests (unit + parsers) are fast enough to run on every commit. This catches obvious regressions before they enter version control, reducing CI feedback time. Full test suite runs in CI.

**Implications**:

- Commits take slightly longer (quick test execution time)
- Developers get immediate local feedback on breaking changes
- `always_run: true` means tests run even if no Python files changed

### Decision 2: Pinned Hook Repository Versions

**Context**: Pre-commit hooks can be pinned to specific versions or use latest

**Decision Made**: Pin all external hooks to specific versions (e.g., `rev: v4.4.0`, `rev: 23.7.0`)

**Rationale**: Pinned versions ensure reproducible behavior across all developer machines and CI. `pre-commit autoupdate` can be used periodically to update versions.

**Implications**:

- Consistent behavior regardless of when hooks are installed
- Requires periodic manual updates to get new features/fixes
- Version alignment with CI tool versions (same black/isort/flake8 versions)
