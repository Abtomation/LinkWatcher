## 1. Feature Overview

### Feature Description

Provides Windows-native development command scripts via `dev.bat` (Windows batch) and `Makefile` (cross-platform make). Both expose identical command sets: `install`, `install-dev`, `test`, `test-quick`, `test-all`, `coverage`, `lint`, `format`, `type-check`, `clean`, `build`, `pre-commit`, `ci-test`, and `dev-setup`. The `dev.bat` uses goto-label routing (`if "%1"=="test" goto test`) for Windows CMD compatibility.

The Makefile adds additional targets: `help` (default, lists all commands), `docs` (placeholder), `release-check` (clean → lint → type-check → test-all → build → twine check). Both scripts delegate to `run_tests.py` for test execution and to standard Python tools (black, isort, flake8, mypy) for quality checks. Manual test scripts (`manual_test/scripts/deploy.ps1`, `manual_test/scripts/setup.ps1`) and placeholder files provide example deployment/config script structures.

### Business Value

- **User Need**: Single-command access to common development tasks on Windows
- **Business Goal**: Lower the barrier to running tests, formatting, and building locally
- **Success Metrics**: `dev test`, `dev lint`, `dev build` all work from project root

### Scope

**In Scope**:

- `dev.bat` — Windows batch command router (20 commands)
- `Makefile` — GNU Make targets (16 phony targets)
- `manual_test/scripts/deploy.ps1`, `manual_test/scripts/setup.ps1` — manual test deployment scripts
- `manual_test/scripts/automation/placeholder.txt`, `manual_test/scripts/config/placeholder.txt` — placeholder files

**Out of Scope**:

- `run_tests.py` test runner logic (covered by 4.1.1)
- Pre-commit installation (covered by 5.1.5)
- CI pipeline (covered by 5.1.1)

## 6. Dependencies

### Feature Dependencies

**This Feature Depends On**:

- **[4.1.1 Test Framework](./4.1.1-test-framework-implementation-state.md)**
  - Why: test/test-quick/test-all/coverage targets invoke `run_tests.py`
  - Status: MAINTAINED
  - Impact if unavailable: Test-related targets would fail

- **[5.1.3 Code Quality Checks](./5.1.3-code-quality-checks-implementation-state.md)**
  - Why: lint/format/type-check targets invoke black, isort, flake8, mypy
  - Status: MAINTAINED
  - Impact if unavailable: Quality targets would fail

- **[5.1.5 Pre-commit Hooks](./5.1.5-pre-commit-hooks-implementation-state.md)**
  - Why: pre-commit and dev-setup targets install pre-commit hooks
  - Status: MAINTAINED
  - Impact if unavailable: Hook installation targets would fail

- **[5.1.6 Package Building](./5.1.6-package-building-implementation-state.md)**
  - Why: build and release-check targets invoke `python -m build` and `twine check`
  - Status: MAINTAINED
  - Impact if unavailable: Build/release targets would fail

**Other Features Depend On This**:

- None (these are developer convenience scripts, not depended upon by other features)

### System Dependencies

**Required Packages**:

| Package | Version | Purpose | Added |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ----- |
| GNU Make | any | Makefile execution (optional, many Windows devs use dev.bat instead) | Pre-existing |

### Code Dependencies

**Existing Code This Feature Imports**:

| Component | Used For | Methods/APIs Used | Notes |
| --------- | -------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| [run_tests.py](../../../../run_tests.py) | All test-related dev commands | `--quick`, `--unit --parsers`, `--all`, `--coverage`, `--discover` | Core test execution backend |
| [requirements.txt](../../../../requirements.txt) | `dev install` and `dev install-dev` | `pip install -r requirements.txt` | Runtime dependency installation |
| [requirements-test.txt](../../../../requirements-test.txt) | `dev install-dev` | `pip install -r requirements-test.txt` | Test dependency installation |

> **Note**: Also uses `python`/`pip` (runtime), `flake8`, `black`, `isort`, `mypy` (external quality tools), `python -m build` (external build), `pre-commit` (external hook manager).

**Reverse Code Dependencies** (files that import this feature):

| Component | How They Use This Feature | Methods/APIs Used | Notes |

| Windows developers | Primary interface for all development tasks | All `dev <command>` invocations | Replaces direct tool invocations |
| [scripts/setup_cicd.py](../../../../scripts/setup_cicd.py) | `run_test_suite()` validates setup | Calls `run_tests.py --discover` and `--quick` | CI environment validation |
| [README.md](../../../../README.md) | Documents `dev` commands for Windows setup | `dev dev-setup`, `dev test`, `dev lint` etc. | Developer onboarding reference |

## 7. Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Dual Script Approach (Makefile + dev.bat)

**Context**: Windows developers may not have GNU Make installed; need a native Windows alternative

**Decision Made**: Provide both `Makefile` (for developers with Make) and `dev.bat` (native Windows CMD) with identical command sets

**Rationale**: `Makefile` is standard for Unix-familiar developers and provides dependency-based execution. `dev.bat` provides the same commands without requiring Make installation. Both delegate to the same underlying tools.

**Implications**:

- Command sets must be kept in sync between both files
- `dev.bat` uses goto-label routing instead of Make's target system
- Makefile provides additional features (phony targets, `release-check` dependency chain)

### Decision 2: Compound dev-setup Target

**Context**: New developers need to set up their environment with multiple steps

**Decision Made**: Provide a `dev-setup` target that chains `install-dev` + `pre-commit` into a single command

**Rationale**: Reduces new developer onboarding to a single command. Follows the principle of least surprise — after running `dev dev-setup`, the environment is fully ready.

**Implications**:

- Single entry point for new developer setup
- Makefile uses `dev-setup: install-dev pre-commit` dependency chain
- dev.bat uses `call :install-dev` + `call :pre-commit` sequential calls
