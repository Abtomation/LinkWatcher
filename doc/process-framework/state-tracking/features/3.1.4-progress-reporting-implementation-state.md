## 1. Feature Overview

### Feature Description

Provides scan progress and operation timing feedback during file processing. The `scan_progress()` method on `LinkWatcherLogger` logs files-scanned vs. total-files counts at DEBUG level, giving real-time visibility into initial scan and monitoring operations.

The `LogTimer` context manager provides automatic operation timing: it logs a `started_*` message on entry, records wall-clock duration via `PerformanceLogger`, and logs either `completed_*` or `failed_*` on exit (with error details on exception). This gives structured timing data for any operation wrapped in a `with LogTimer(...)` block.

### Business Value

- **User Need**: Know how far along a scan or update operation is, and how long operations take
- **Business Goal**: Provide feedback during long-running operations to prevent the appearance of a hung process
- **Success Metrics**: Progress messages visible during initial scan; operation durations logged with millisecond precision

### Scope

**In Scope**:

- `scan_progress()` method with `files_scanned` and optional `total_files` parameters
- `LogTimer` context manager for automatic start/end/error timing
- Integration with `PerformanceLogger.start_timer()`/`end_timer()` for metric recording
- DEBUG-level progress messages (non-intrusive in normal output)

**Out of Scope**:

- Progress bars or TUI progress indicators
- Percentage-based progress estimation

## 6. Dependencies

### Feature Dependencies

**This Feature Depends On**:

- **[3.1.1 Logging Framework](./3.1.1-logging-framework-implementation-state.md)**
  - Why: `scan_progress()` is a method on `LinkWatcherLogger`; `LogTimer` uses `PerformanceLogger` and the global logger
  - Status: COMPLETE
  - Impact if unavailable: No progress or timing output
- **[3.1.2 Colored Console Output](./3.1.2-colored-console-output-implementation-state.md)**
  - Why: Progress messages are formatted through `ColoredFormatter` for visual display
  - Status: COMPLETE
  - Impact if unavailable: Progress messages still appear but without colors/icons

**Other Features Depend On This**:

- **[0.1.1 Core Architecture](./0.1.1-core-architecture-implementation-state.md)** — service.py wraps operations in `LogTimer` for timing
- **[1.1.2 Event Handler](./1.1.2-event-handler-implementation-state.md)** — handler.py uses `LogTimer` for event processing timing
- **[2.1.1 Parser Framework](./2.1.1-parser-framework-implementation-state.md)** — parser.py uses `LogTimer` for parse timing

### System Dependencies

**Required Packages**:

None beyond those required by 3.1.1 Logging Framework.

### Code Dependencies

**Existing Code This Feature Imports**:

| Component | Used For | Methods/APIs Used | Notes |
| --------- | -------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| [linkwatcher/logging.py](../../../../linkwatcher/logging.py) | Logging infrastructure | `get_logger()`, `logger.info()`, `scan_progress()` | Structured progress logs |
| `colorama` | Colored progress output | `Fore`, `Style` | Visual progress indicators |

> **Note**: Also uses `time.perf_counter()` (stdlib, high-resolution timing in `LogTimer` and `PerformanceLogger`).

**Reverse Code Dependencies** (files that import this feature):

| Component | How They Use This Feature | Methods/APIs Used | Notes |
| --------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| This feature is implemented in `linkwatcher/service.py` and `linkwatcher/logging.py`. Reverse dependencies of [core-architecture (0.1.1)](./0.1.1-core-architecture-implementation-state.md) and [logging-framework (3.1.1)](./3.1.1-logging-framework-implementation-state.md) also consume this feature indirectly via `LogTimer`. | | | |

## 7. Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Context Manager for Operation Timing (LogTimer)

**Context**: Need to time arbitrary operations with automatic start/end logging and exception handling.

**Decision Made**: `LogTimer` as a `__enter__`/`__exit__` context manager that wraps `PerformanceLogger`.

**Rationale**: Context manager guarantees `end_timer()` is called even on exception. Clean syntax (`with LogTimer("op"):`) requires no manual cleanup. Exception info is automatically captured in `__exit__`.

**Implications**:
- Every timed operation gets 3 log entries: `started_*`, then either `completed_*` or `failed_*`, plus the PerformanceLogger's `operation_completed` metric
- No support for nested timing with parent/child relationships (flat timer IDs only)

### Decision 2: Progress at DEBUG Level

**Context**: Progress messages during initial scan could be verbose for normal users.

**Decision Made**: `scan_progress()` logs at DEBUG level, not INFO.

**Rationale**: Normal users see only INFO+ by default. Progress messages are most useful during development/debugging. Users can enable with `--debug` CLI flag.

### Decision 3: Optional total_files Parameter

**Context**: Total file count may not be known in advance (streaming scan).

**Decision Made**: `scan_progress(files_scanned, total_files=None)` — total_files is optional.

**Rationale**: Allows progress reporting both with known totals (percentage possible) and unknown totals (count only). Consumer code decides what to display.

---

### Implementation Patterns Used

**Context Manager Pattern**:
- Pattern: `__enter__`/`__exit__` with `try/finally` semantics
- Why: Guaranteed cleanup and exception-safe timing
- Where: `LogTimer` used across service.py, handler.py, parser.py

**Timer ID Pattern**:
- Pattern: `f"{operation}_{int(time.time() * 1000000)}"` for unique timer IDs
- Why: Supports concurrent timers for same operation name without collision
- Where: `PerformanceLogger.start_timer()`
