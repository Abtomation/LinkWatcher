# Retrospective Documentation Creation

## Purpose & Context

For each analyzed feature, create or validate a tier assessment, then produce the required design documentation (FDD, TDD, Test Specifications, ADRs) based on that tier. After all features are documented, verify completeness, finalize tracking, and archive the master state file.

This is the final onboarding task that transforms code analysis into formal design documentation, completing the framework adoption process.

## AI Agent Role

**Role**: Technical Documentation Specialist & Codebase Archaeologist
**Mindset**: Documentation-focused, quality-driven, completeness-oriented
**Focus Areas**: Tier assessment, design documentation creation, documentation completeness verification
**Communication Style**: Report documentation progress, ask about design rationale for unclear decisions, confirm tier assignments

## When to Use

- After [Codebase Feature Analysis (PF-TSK-065)](codebase-feature-analysis.md) is complete
- [Master state file](../../state-tracking/temporary/retrospective-master-state.md) shows Phase 2 done (all features analyzed)
- All [Feature Implementation State files](../../state-tracking/features/) have enriched analysis content
- Ready to create formal design documentation

## Process

> **CRITICAL: This is a MULTI-SESSION task. Every session must start by reading the master state file and end by updating it.**
>
> **Priority order**: Foundation (0.x.x) first → Tier 3 → Tier 2. Tier 1 features only need assessment validation (no documentation beyond implementation state file).
>
> **FEEDBACK: Complete feedback forms after EVERY session, not just at the end.**

### Preparation

1. **Read [Master State File](../../state-tracking/temporary/retrospective-master-state.md)**:
   - Verify Phase 2 is complete
   - Identify which features still need assessment and documentation
   - Set status to "ASSESSMENT_AND_DOCUMENTATION" if not already

### Phase 3: Tier Assessment & Documentation Creation

#### Per Feature: Assess

2. **Create or Validate Tier Assessment**:
   - **If no assessment exists**: Use [Feature Tier Assessment Task](../01-planning/feature-tier-assessment-task.md)
     - Base scores on ACTUAL code analysis from PF-TSK-065 (not assumptions)
     - Use [Feature Implementation State file](../../state-tracking/features/) as evidence
     - Create assessment artifact
   - **If assessment already exists**: Validate against analysis findings
     - Compare assessment tier with actual complexity discovered
     - If inaccurate, update the assessment
     - Document any discrepancies in master state session notes
   - Update [Feature Tracking](../../state-tracking/permanent/feature-tracking.md) with tier assignment
   - Update [master state](../../state-tracking/temporary/retrospective-master-state.md): mark feature as "📊 Assessment Created"

#### Per Feature: Document (Tier 2+ only)

> **Extraction-First Principle**: Before writing any design document from scratch, check the feature's Section 4 "Existing Project Documentation" table for entries marked `Confirmed` or `Partially Accurate`. Extract validated content from those sources first, then supplement with findings from source code analysis. When reusing content, include attribution (e.g., "Derived from HOW_IT_WORKS.md, Architecture section").

3. **Create Functional Design Document (Tier 2+)**:
   - Use [FDD Creation Task](../02-design/fdd-creation-task.md)
   - **Source**: [Feature Implementation State file](../../state-tracking/features/) + existing code
   - **Check first**: Section 4 "Existing Project Documentation" for confirmed docs with functional/user-facing content
   - **Approach**: Descriptive (what it does) not prescriptive (what it should do)
   - **Content**: Document actual functionality, user flows, business rules as implemented
   - **Mark**: Add "Retrospective" note in header
   - Update master state: FDD ✅ for this feature

4. **Create Technical Design Document (Tier 2+)**:
   - Use [TDD Creation Task](../02-design/tdd-creation-task.md)
   - **Source**: [Feature Implementation State file](../../state-tracking/features/) (Component Architecture, Data Flow, Design Decisions)
   - **Check first**: Section 4 "Existing Project Documentation" for confirmed docs with architecture/technical content
   - **Approach**: Reverse-engineer from actual code structure
   - **Content**: Document actual architecture, components, patterns, implementation decisions
   - **Mark**: Add "Retrospective" note in header
   - Update master state: TDD ✅ for this feature

5. **Create Test Specification (Tier 3 only)**:
   - Use [Test Specification Creation Task](../03-testing/test-specification-creation-task.md)
   - **Source**: [Feature Implementation State file](../../state-tracking/features/) → Test Files section
   - **Content**: Document existing tests, coverage, test scenarios
   - **Gaps**: Identify missing test coverage
   - **Cross-cutting**: If test-registry.yaml shows test files with `crossCuttingFeatures` spanning multiple features, create cross-cutting test specifications using `New-TestSpecification.ps1 -CrossCutting -FeatureIds "X.Y.Z,A.B.C" -FeatureName "scenario-name"`. These go in `/test/specifications/cross-cutting-specs/`
   - **Mark**: Add "Retrospective" note in header
   - Update master state: Test Spec ✅

6. **Create Architecture Decision Records (Foundation 0.x.x)**:
   - Use [ADR Creation Task](../02-design/adr-creation-task.md)
   - **Source**: [Feature Implementation State file](../../state-tracking/features/) → Design Decisions
   - **Content**: Document architectural patterns/decisions discovered in code
   - **Note**: Mark unknowns (alternatives considered, full rationale) clearly
   - Update master state: ADR ✅

7. **Create Conditional Documents** (if tier assessment indicates):
   - **API Design**: Use [API Design Task](../02-design/api-design-task.md) — document existing API contracts
   - **Database Schema**: Use [Database Schema Design Task](../02-design/database-schema-design-task.md) — document existing schema
   - Update master state for each document created

#### After Each Feature

8. **Update [Feature Tracking](../../state-tracking/permanent/feature-tracking.md)**:
   - Add document links to appropriate columns as documents are created

9. **Update [Master State](../../state-tracking/temporary/retrospective-master-state.md) After Each Session**:
   - Mark assessment and document completion status per feature
   - Log session notes
   - **Complete feedback form for the session**

### Phase 4: Finalization

10. **Verify Codebase Coverage**:
    - All source files assigned to at least one feature? ✅
    - All features have [Feature Implementation State files](../../state-tracking/features/)? ✅
    - Coverage metric = 100%? ✅

11. **Verify Documentation Completeness**:
    - All features have tier assessments (created or validated)? ✅
    - All Tier 2+ features have FDD and TDD? ✅
    - All Tier 3 features have Test Specifications? ✅
    - Foundation features have ADRs (where architectural decisions exist)? ✅
    - All conditional documents created per assessment? ✅
    - All documents marked "Retrospective"? ✅

12. **Verify Tracking Completeness**:
    - All document links in [Feature Tracking](../../state-tracking/permanent/feature-tracking.md)? ✅
    - All [Feature Implementation State files](../../state-tracking/features/) linked in Feature Tracking? ✅

13. **Reconcile Pre-existing Documentation**:
    - Review the master state "Existing Documentation Inventory" table
    - For each document, determine its disposition:
      - **Keep**: Document serves an ongoing project purpose beyond what FDDs/TDDs cover (e.g., README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CHANGELOG.md, tests/README.md)
      - **Archive**: Document's content has been fully extracted into formal design documents and no longer serves a unique purpose (e.g., HOW_IT_WORKS.md superseded by TDDs/FDDs)
    - Archive superseded documents: move to `doc/archived-pre-framework/`
    - Update the master state inventory with the disposition (Keep / Archived) for each document

14. **Update Documentation Map**: Add all new documents to [Documentation Map](../../documentation-map.md)

15. **Calculate Final Metrics**:
    - Total features documented
    - Total documents created (by type)
    - Total sessions and time spent
    - Coverage percentage achieved
    - Record in [master state file](../../state-tracking/temporary/retrospective-master-state.md) Completion Summary section

16. **Archive Master State File**:
    - Move from `/temporary/` to `/temporary/archived/` (or `/temporary/old/`)

17. **🚨 MANDATORY FINAL STEP**: Complete the [Task Completion Checklist](#task-completion-checklist) below
