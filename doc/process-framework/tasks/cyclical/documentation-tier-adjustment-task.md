# Documentation Tier Adjustment Task

## Purpose & Context

Ensure documentation requirements remain aligned with the true complexity of features by adjusting documentation tiers during implementation when actual complexity differs from initial assessments, preventing both documentation debt and excessive documentation.

## AI Agent Role

**Role**: Technical Writer
**Mindset**: Clarity-focused, user-oriented, structured
**Focus Areas**: Documentation quality, information architecture, usability, appropriate documentation levels
**Communication Style**: Ensure documentation serves its intended audience, ask about documentation needs and complexity changes

## When to Use

- When implementation reveals that a feature's complexity differs significantly from initial assessment
- After completing key implementation milestones (data model, business logic, UI components)
- When encountering unexpected challenges that affect feature complexity
- During regular implementation reviews
- When feature requirements change significantly

## Context Requirements

- [Documentation Tier Adjustment Context Map](/doc/process-framework/visualization/context-maps/cyclical/documentation-tier-adjustment-map.md) - Visual guide to the components relevant to this task

- **Critical (Must Read):**

  - [Original Assessment Document](../../../process-framework/methodologies/documentation-tiers/assessments) - Initial complexity assessment
  - [Documentation Tiers](/doc/product-docs/guides/guides/documentation-tiers-guide.md) - Tier definitions and criteria
  - <!-- [Normalized Scoring System](../../../process-framework/methodologies/documentation-tiers/normalized-scoring-guide.md) - File not found --> - Guide for scoring complexity
  - [Visual Notation Guide](/doc/process-framework/guides/guides/visual-notation-guide.md) - For interpreting context map diagrams

- **Reference Only (Access When Needed):**
  - [Feature Tracking Document](../../state-tracking/permanent/feature-tracking.md) - Current documentation tier assignment

## Process

> **🚨 CRITICAL: This task is NOT complete until ALL steps including feedback forms are finished! 🚨**
>
> **⚠️ MANDATORY: Always document adjustment rationale for future reference and process improvement.**

### Preparation

1. **Recognize Complexity Changes**

   - During implementation, identify if the feature's actual complexity differs significantly from the initial assessment
   - Document specific complexity factors that have changed
   - Collect evidence to support the need for adjustment

2. **Quantify Complexity Changes**
   - Reassess the complexity factors using the normalized scoring system
   - Recalculate the normalized score
   - Determine if the new score falls into a different tier range

### Execution

3. **Document the Adjustment Rationale**

   - Document which specific complexity factors changed and why
   - Explain the impact on the overall complexity
   - Note any lessons learned for future assessments
   - Identify patterns that could improve initial assessments

4. **Update the Documentation Tier**
   - Update the feature's assessment document with the new tier
   - Update the feature tracking document with the new tier emoji
   - Update any project management tools to reflect the new requirements

### Finalization

5. **Adapt Documentation Plan**

   - If upgrading to a higher tier: Create or expand documentation as needed
   - If downgrading to a lower tier: Simplify planned documentation
   - Allocate appropriate time for documentation tasks

6. **Implement Documentation Changes**
   - Create or modify documentation according to the new tier requirements
   - Ensure documentation meets the standards for the new tier
   - **🚨 MANDATORY FINAL STEP**: Complete the Task Completion Checklist below

## Cycle Frequency

- As needed during feature implementation
- At key implementation milestones:
  - After data model implementation
  - After core business logic implementation
  - After UI component creation

## Trigger Events

- Discovery of unexpected complexity factors
- Simplification of initially complex aspects
- Completion of key implementation milestones
- Significant changes to feature requirements

## Outputs

- **Updated Assessment Document** - Revised complexity assessment with new tier assignment
- **Adjustment Rationale** - Documentation of why the adjustment was needed
- **Updated Documentation** - Documentation that meets the requirements of the new tier

## State Tracking

The following state files must be updated as part of this task:

- [Feature Tracking Document](../../state-tracking/permanent/feature-tracking.md) - Update with:
  - New documentation tier emoji (🔵/🟠/🔴)
  - Link to updated assessment document
  - Date of tier adjustment
  - Notes about why the adjustment was needed

## ⚠️ MANDATORY Task Completion Checklist

**🚨 TASK IS NOT COMPLETE UNTIL ALL ITEMS BELOW ARE CHECKED OFF 🚨**

Before considering this task finished:

- [ ] **Verify Outputs**: Confirm all required outputs have been produced
  - [ ] Updated assessment document with new tier assignment
  - [ ] Documented adjustment rationale with specific complexity factors
  - [ ] Updated documentation that meets the new tier requirements
  - [ ] Evidence supporting the need for adjustment
- [ ] **Update State Files**: Ensure all state tracking files have been updated
  - [ ] Feature tracking document shows the new documentation tier
  - [ ] Project timeline reflects any changes to documentation schedule
  - [ ] Adjustment date and rationale are recorded
- [ ] **Complete Feedback Forms**: Follow the [Feedback Form Completion Instructions](../../guides/guides/feedback-form-completion-instructions.md) for each tool used, using task ID "PF-TSK-011" and context "Documentation Tier Adjustment"
- [ ] **Communicate Changes**: Ensure all stakeholders are aware of the tier adjustment and its implications

## Next Tasks

- [**Feature Implementation Planning**](../04-implementation/feature-implementation-planning-task.md) - Continue with implementation planning using updated requirements
- [**Tools Review**](../support/tools-review-task.md) - If assessment tools need improvement based on findings

## Related Resources

- [Assessment Guide](../../guides/guides/assessment-guide.md) - Guide for assessing feature complexity
- [Task Creation and Improvement Guide](../../../process-framework/tasks/task-creation-guide.md) - Guide for creating and improving tasks

## Metrics and Evaluation

- **Adjustment Frequency**: Percentage of features requiring tier adjustments
- **Assessment Accuracy**: Improvement in initial assessment accuracy over time
- **Documentation Quality**: Alignment between documentation and actual feature complexity
- **Success Criteria**: Documentation quality matches actual feature complexity with minimal disruption to project timeline

## Continuous Improvement

The tier adjustment process should be evaluated periodically:

- Review patterns in tier adjustments to improve initial assessments
- Refine complexity factors and weights based on implementation experience
- Update assessment guidelines to capture commonly missed complexity indicators
- Improve the efficiency of the adjustment process itself
