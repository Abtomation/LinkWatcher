# Enhancement State Tracking: [Enhancement Name]

> **TEMPORARY FILE**: This file tracks enhancement work on an existing feature. Created by Feature Request Evaluation (PF-TSK-067), consumed by Feature Enhancement (PF-TSK-068). Move to `state-tracking/temporary/old/` when all steps are complete.

## Enhancement Overview

| Metadata | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Target Feature** | [Feature ID] — [Feature Name] |
| **Enhancement Description** | [Brief description of what is being enhanced] |
| **Change Request** | [Summary of original change request] |
| **Human Approval** | [Date] — Target feature confirmed by human partner |
| **Estimated Sessions** | [1 / 2 / 3+] |
| **Created By** | Feature Request Evaluation (PF-TSK-067) |

## Scope Assessment

| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| **Files Affected** | [Estimated count and list of key files] |
| **Design Docs to Amend** | [FDD / TDD / ADR — list which ones] |
| **New Tests Required** | [Yes — new test cases / No — modify existing only] |
| **Interface Impact** | [Public interface change / Internal only] |
| **Session Estimate** | [Single session / Multi-session with rationale] |

## Existing Documentation Inventory

| Document Type | ID | Location | Action Needed |
|---------------|-----|----------|---------------|
| Feature State File | [PF-FEA-XXX] | [Link to state file] | Update on completion |
| FDD | [PD-FDD-XXX or N/A] | [Link or "None exists"] | [Amend / Create / No change] |
| TDD | [PD-TDD-XXX or N/A] | [Link or "None exists"] | [Amend / Create / No change] |
| ADR | [PD-ADR-XXX or N/A] | [Link or "None exists"] | [Amend / Create / No change] |
| Test Specification | [PF-TSP-XXX or N/A] | [Link or "None exists"] | [Amend / Create / No change] |

## Execution Steps

> **Structure**: These steps follow the standard feature development workflow from the [Task Transition Guide](../../guides/guides/task-transition-guide.md). Each block corresponds to a task type in the workflow. The Feature Request Evaluation task (PF-TSK-067) marks each block as **Applicable** or **Not applicable** based on the enhancement scope. The Feature Enhancement task (PF-TSK-068) executes applicable blocks in order.

- **Referenced Task Doc**: [Documentation Tier Adjustment (PF-TSK-011)](../../tasks/cyclical/documentation-tier-adjustment-task.md)
- **Rationale**: [Why tier reassessment is or is not needed — e.g., "Enhancement adds significant complexity to a Tier 1 feature" or "Not applicable — enhancement is minor, current tier remains appropriate"]
- **Adaptation Notes**: [Reassess the target feature's documentation tier. If the tier increases, additional design documentation steps below become required. If unchanged, confirm and proceed.]
