## Current State Analysis

### Code Quality Metrics (Baseline)
<!-- Record current metrics before refactoring -->
- **Complexity Score**: [Current complexity measurement]
- **Maintainability Index**: [Current maintainability score]
- **Code Coverage**: [Current test coverage percentage]
- **Technical Debt**: [Current technical debt assessment]

### Affected Components
<!-- List all files, modules, or components that will be modified -->
- Component 1: `[file/module path]` - [Brief description]
- Component 2: `[file/module path]` - [Brief description]
- Component 3: `[file/module path]` - [Brief description]

## Success Criteria

### Quality Improvements
<!-- Measurable improvements expected from refactoring -->
- **Complexity Reduction**: Target [X]% reduction in complexity score
- **Maintainability**: Target [X]% improvement in maintainability index
- **Performance**: [Expected performance improvements, if any]
- **Technical Debt**: Target [X]% reduction in technical debt items

### Functional Requirements
<!-- Ensure no functional changes -->
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] No breaking changes to public APIs
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass
- [ ] Performance maintained or improved
