# Foundational Features Validation Tracking - Round 2

## Purpose & Context

This file tracks the progress and results of the **Foundational Codebase Validation Framework** across all validation types and **foundational features (0.2.1-0.2.11)**. This is the second validation round conducted after major remediation efforts to compare improvements and identify remaining issues. It provides a centralized view of validation status, findings, and remediation progress.

## Validation Framework Overview

### Validation Types

1. **Architectural Consistency Validation** - Design patterns, component structure, interfaces
2. **Code Quality & Standards Validation** - Code style, complexity, error handling, documentation
3. **Integration & Dependencies Validation** - Service integration, state management, navigation
4. **Documentation Alignment Validation** - TDD/FDD alignment, API documentation currency
5. **Extensibility & Maintainability Validation** - Modularity, extensibility points, scalability
6. **AI Agent Continuity Validation** - Context optimization, documentation clarity, readability
