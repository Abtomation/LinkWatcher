# Implementation Checklists

This directory contains checklists for various implementation tasks in the Breakout Buddies application. These checklists help ensure consistent implementation and reduce the chance of missing important steps.

*Last updated: 2025-05-21*

## Purpose

Implementation checklists serve several important purposes:

1. **Consistency**: Ensure that all implementations follow the same standards and best practices
2. **Completeness**: Reduce the chance of missing important steps
3. **Quality**: Improve the overall quality of the codebase
4. **Review**: Provide a reference for code reviews

## Available Checklists

- [UI Component Checklist](checklists/ui-component-checklist.md) - Checklist for implementing UI components
- [API Integration Checklist](checklists/api-integration-checklist.md) - Checklist for integrating with APIs

- [Performance Checklist](checklists/performance-checklist.md) - Checklist for performance considerations

## How to Use Checklists

1. **Before Implementation**: Review the relevant checklist to understand the requirements
2. **During Implementation**: Use the checklist as a guide to ensure all steps are completed
3. **After Implementation**: Use the checklist to verify that all requirements have been met
4. **During Self-Review**: Take a short break, then use the checklist as a reference for reviewing your own code
5. **Before Committing**: Verify that all checklist items have been addressed
