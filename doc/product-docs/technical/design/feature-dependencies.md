## Feature Priority Matrix

This matrix combines dependency information with feature priority to help guide implementation decisions.

**Priority Legend:**
- **P1**: Critical - Must have for MVP
- **P2**: High - Important for core functionality
- **P3**: Medium - Valuable but not critical
- **P4**: Low - Nice to have
- **P5**: Future - Planned for later phases

| Feature | Dependencies | Priority | Complexity (1-5) | Value (1-5) | Implementation Order |
|---------|--------------|----------|------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Phase 1:** |
| **Phase 2:** |
