## Creating Technical Documentation

When creating technical documentation:

1. Choose the appropriate subdirectory based on the content type
2. Use the relevant template from `/doc/product-docs/templates/`
3. Include detailed technical information with diagrams where appropriate
4. Follow the [Process: Documentation Guide](/doc/process-framework/guides/guides/documentation-guide.md) for general documentation standards
5. Add your document to the [Process: Documentation Map](/doc/process-framework/documentation-map.md)

## Best Practices

- Include diagrams to illustrate complex concepts
- Provide code examples where relevant
- Link to related technical documents
- Keep implementation details separate from architectural decisions
- Document assumptions and constraints
- Include rationale for technical decisions
