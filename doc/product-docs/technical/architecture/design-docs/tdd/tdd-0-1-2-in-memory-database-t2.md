# Lightweight Technical Design Document: In-Memory Database

> **Retrospective Document**: This TDD describes the existing technical design of the LinkWatcher In-Memory Database, documented after implementation during framework onboarding (PF-TSK-066). Content is reverse-engineered from source code analysis.
>
> **Source**: Derived from [0.1.3 Implementation State](../../../../state-tracking/features/archive/0.1.3-in-memory-database-implementation-state.md) and source code analysis of `linkwatcher/database.py`.

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

The In-Memory Database (`LinkDatabase`) provides thread-safe, target-indexed storage of all link references discovered during file scanning. It enables O(1) lookup of "all files that reference a given target file" — the critical operation when a file is moved or renamed.

### 1.2 Related Features

| Feature | Relationship | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Data Models (part of 0.1.1) | Data dependency | Stores `LinkReference` instances as values in target-indexed dictionary |
| 0.1.1 Core Architecture | Integration | `LinkWatcherService` holds the primary `LinkDatabase` instance; database is shared across all service operations |
| 1.1.1 File System Monitoring | Consumer | Handler queries database via `get_references_to_file()` when files move |
| 2.1.1 Parser Framework | Producer | Parsers create `LinkReference` instances that are added via `add_link()` |
| 3.1.1 Logging Framework | Cross-cutting | Uses `get_logger()` for database operation logging |

## 2. Key Requirements

**Key technical requirements this design satisfies:**

1. **O(1) target path lookups**: When a file moves, all files referencing it must be found instantly (target-indexed dictionary)
2. **Thread safety**: Concurrent access from watchdog observer thread and main service thread (single `threading.Lock`)
3. **Path diversity handling**: Lookups succeed for anchored links (`file.md#section`), relative paths, and filename-only references (three-level resolution strategy)
4. **Zero persistent state**: In-memory only — rebuilt on every service restart to avoid stale data
5. **Statistics reporting**: `get_stats()` provides operational metrics (total links, total targets, files with links)

## 3. Quality Attribute Requirements

### 3.1 Performance Requirements

- **Response Time**: Target path lookups complete in O(1) time (dictionary access); sub-millisecond lookup performance confirmed in unit tests with 10,000+ references
- **Throughput**: File system events arrive at human speed (manual file operations); single lock serialization is sufficient for expected event rate
- **Resource Usage**: Memory scales linearly with number of tracked links; acceptable overhead (<100MB for typical projects with 10,000 files and ~50,000 links)

### 3.2 Security Requirements

- **Data Protection**: Database stores file paths only (no sensitive data); paths are normalized but not validated for traversal attacks (handled by 0.1.5 Path Utilities upstream)
- **Input Validation**: Assumes `LinkReference` instances from parsers are well-formed; no validation layer in database itself

### 3.3 Reliability Requirements

- **Error Handling**: Path normalization failures are silently handled (malformed paths stored as-is; three-level resolution compensates)
- **Data Integrity**: Single lock guarantees consistency; no race conditions between concurrent `add_link()` and `get_references_to_file()` operations
- **Monitoring**: Logs reference removal operations via `get_logger()`; warns when `remove_file_links()` finds no references to remove

### 3.4 Usability Requirements

- **Developer Experience**: Simple public API with 12 methods: `add_link()`, `remove_file_links()`, `get_references_to_file()`, `update_target_path()`, `update_source_path()`, `remove_targets_by_path()`, `get_references_to_directory()`, `get_all_targets_with_references()`, `get_source_files()`, `has_target_with_basename()`, `clear()`, `get_stats()` (plus `last_scan` property)
- **Transparency**: Database operates transparently; developers interact with high-level service methods rather than database directly

## 4. Technical Design

### 4.1 Data Models

**Primary storage structure:**

```python
class LinkDatabaseInterface(ABC):
    """Abstract interface for link database implementations."""
    # Declares abstract methods: add_link, remove_file_links,
    # get_references_to_file, update_target_path, remove_targets_by_path,
    # get_references_to_directory, get_all_targets_with_references,
    # get_source_files, clear, get_stats, last_scan (property)

class LinkDatabase(LinkDatabaseInterface):
    def __init__(self):
        # Target-indexed dictionary: target_path -> [LinkReference, ...]
        self.links: Dict[str, List[LinkReference]] = {}

        # Set of source files that contain at least one link
        self.files_with_links: Set[str] = set()

        # Timestamp of last scan (property backed by _last_scan)
        self._last_scan: Optional[float] = None

        # Single lock protecting all operations
        self._lock = threading.Lock()

        # Structured logger instance
        self.logger = get_logger()
```

**Key design decisions:**

- **Target-indexed** (`Dict[str, List[LinkReference]]`): Keys are target paths; values are lists of all references to that target. Optimizes for the critical query: "what files link to this moved file?"
- **Single lock**: `threading.Lock()` serializes all CRUD operations. Simple, safe, sufficient for low-frequency file system events.
- **Auxiliary set**: `files_with_links` tracks which source files contain links (used for cleanup and statistics).

### 4.2 Core Operations

**CRUD operations:**

```python
# CREATE/ADD
def add_link(self, reference: LinkReference):
    """Add a link reference to the database (skips duplicates)."""
    with self._lock:
        target = normalize_path(reference.link_target)
        if target not in self.links:
            self.links[target] = []
        # Guard: skip duplicate references (same source + line + column)
        source_norm = normalize_path(reference.file_path)
        for ref in self.links[target]:
            if (normalize_path(ref.file_path) == source_norm
                    and ref.line_number == reference.line_number
                    and ref.column_start == reference.column_start):
                return
        self.links[target].append(reference)
        self.files_with_links.add(reference.file_path)

        return all_references

# UPDATE
def update_target_path(self, old_path: str, new_path: str):
    """Update target path for all references when a file moves."""

        removed_count = 0
        for target, references in self.links.items():

                ref for ref in references
                if normalize_path(ref.file_path) != normalized_file_path
            ]
            removed_count += original_count - len(self.links[target])

        # Clean up empty entries
        self.links = {k: v for k, v in self.links.items() if v}

        # Log results

**Source path update (when a source file moves):**

```python
# UPDATE SOURCE
def update_source_path(self, old_path: str, new_path: str) -> int:
    """Update file_path on all references whose source matches old_path.
    Returns the number of references updated.
    Uses reverse index (_source_to_targets) for O(R) lookup instead of
    scanning all targets — R = number of targets referenced by old_path.
    """
    with self._lock:
        old_normalized = normalize_path(old_path)
        new_normalized = normalize_path(new_path)
        updated = 0

        # Use reverse index to find only the targets referenced by old source
        target_keys = self._source_to_targets.get(old_normalized, set())
        for target in target_keys:
            for ref in self.links.get(target, []):
                if normalize_path(ref.file_path) == old_normalized:
                    ref.file_path = new_path
                    updated += 1

        # Update reverse index: move entry from old key to new key
        if updated:
            targets = self._source_to_targets.pop(old_normalized, set())

            self.files_with_links.add(new_path)
        return updated
```

**Directory reference query (for directory moves):**

```python
# READ (directory)
def get_references_to_directory(self, dir_path: str) -> List[LinkReference]:
    """Get all references whose target matches a directory path.
    Finds references where link_target equals the directory (exact match)
    or starts with it as a prefix (subdirectory references).
    Used during directory moves to update directory-path string references
    in scripts (e.g., quoted paths in PowerShell files).
    """
    with self._lock:
        normalized_dir = normalize_path(dir_path)
        dir_prefix = normalized_dir.rstrip("/") + "/"
        all_references = []
        seen = set()

        for target_path, references in self.links.items():
            normalized_target = normalize_path(target_path)
            # Exact match or prefix match (subdirectory)
            if normalized_target == normalized_dir or normalized_target.startswith(dir_prefix):
                for ref in references:
                    if id(ref) not in seen:
                        seen.add(id(ref))
                        all_references.append(ref)

        return all_references
```

### 4.3 Path Normalization

**Shared utility:** The database imports `normalize_path()` from `linkwatcher/utils.py` (part of 0.1.1 Core Architecture) rather than implementing its own private method. This was consolidated during TD001/TD002 to eliminate duplicate implementations across modules.

```python
from .utils import normalize_path

# normalize_path(path) strips leading slash, normalizes separators
# to forward slashes, and resolves .. and . components.
```

**Critical for correctness:** Ensures paths stored as `docs/README.md`, `./docs/README.md`, and `docs\\README.md` all resolve to the same normalized key.

### 4.4 Quality Attribute Implementation

#### Performance Implementation

- **O(1) lookups**: Direct dictionary access for exact matches (`if normalized_path in self.links`)
- **Linear scan fallback**: Three-level resolution requires scanning all keys (acceptable given low key count in typical projects: hundreds to thousands, not millions)
- **Memory efficiency**: Single storage structure (no bi-directional index duplicating data)

#### Security Implementation

- **No validation**: Database trusts upstream path utilities (0.1.5) to prevent traversal attacks
- **Mutable references**: `LinkReference` fields can be reassigned (e.g., `update_target_path()` mutates `ref.link_target`); dataclass fields are not frozen

#### Reliability Implementation

- **Coarse-grained locking**: Single lock eliminates deadlock risk; acceptable given low contention
- **Defensive cleanup**: `remove_file_links()` cleans up empty dictionary entries to prevent memory leaks
- **Logging on anomalies**: Warns when attempting to remove references from a file that has none

#### Usability Implementation

- **Simple API**: 12 public methods cover all use cases
- **Transparent operation**: Service layer handles database calls; feature implementations don't interact with database directly

## 5. Cross-References

### 5.1 Functional Requirements Reference

> **📋 Primary Documentation**: [FDD PD-FDD-023](../../../../functional-design/fdds/fdd-0-1-2-in-memory-database.md)
> **👤 Owner**: FDD Creation Task

**Brief Summary**: The FDD defines the user-facing behavior enabled by O(1) lookups (instant link updates when files move), thread-safe concurrent access (service and watchdog threads), and zero persistent state (rebuilt on every startup).

### 5.2 API Specification Reference

> **📋 Primary Documentation**: N/A (internal component, no external API)

**Brief Summary**: Database is an internal component used only by `LinkWatcherService` and `LinkMaintenanceHandler`. No public API surface.

### 5.3 Database Schema Reference

> **📋 Primary Documentation**: N/A (in-memory only, no persistent schema)

**Brief Summary**: In-memory `Dict[str, List[LinkReference]]` structure. No persistent database.

### 5.4 Testing Reference

> **📋 Primary Documentation**: `test/automated/unit/test_database.py`

**Brief Summary**: Unit tests cover CRUD operations, thread safety (concurrent add/query operations), path lookups (anchors, relative paths), O(1) performance verification (10,000+ references), and statistics reporting.

## 6. Implementation Plan

### 6.1 Dependencies

**Implemented first (already complete):**
- Data Models (part of 0.1.1): `LinkReference` dataclass
- Path Utilities (part of 0.1.1): `normalize_path()` shared function
- 3.1.1 Logging Framework: `get_logger()` for operation logging

**Consumes this database:**
- 0.1.1 Core Architecture: Service instantiates database
- 1.1.1 File System Monitoring: Queries database on file move events
- 2.1.1 Parser Framework: Parsers populate database during scan

### 6.2 Implementation Steps

**Already implemented (retrospective):**

1. ✅ Define `LinkDatabase` class with target-indexed dictionary structure
2. ✅ Implement `add_link()` with thread-safe insertion
3. ✅ Implement `get_references_to_file()` with three-level path resolution
4. ✅ Implement `update_target_path()` for bulk reference updates on file moves
5. ✅ Implement `remove_file_links()` for cleanup when source files are deleted
6. ✅ Implement `_normalize_path()` for consistent key comparison
7. ✅ Add `get_stats()` for operational metrics
8. ✅ Add `clear()` for database reset
9. ✅ Write unit tests covering all operations and thread safety

## 7. Quality Measurement

### 7.1 Performance Monitoring

- **Lookup time**: Unit tests verify O(1) performance with 10,000+ references (sub-millisecond)
- **Memory usage**: Monitor via `get_stats()` — total references and target count
- **No profiling in production**: In-memory database performance is not a bottleneck in practice

### 7.2 Security Validation

- **No security surface**: Database stores paths only; no user input, no external access
- **Upstream validation**: 0.1.5 Path Utilities handles path traversal prevention

### 7.3 Reliability Monitoring

- **Thread safety**: Verified in unit tests with concurrent add/query operations
- **Data consistency**: Integration tests verify database state after file move sequences
- **Error logging**: `get_logger()` captures anomalies (e.g., remove called on file with no links)

### 7.4 User Experience Metrics

- **Indirect impact**: Fast lookups enable sub-second link updates (measured at service level, not database level)
- **No direct user metrics**: Database is transparent internal component

## 8. Open Questions

**Resolved (retrospective):**

- ✅ **Why target-indexed instead of source-indexed?** → Critical operation is "find all files referencing a moved file" (O(1) with target-indexing, O(n) with source-indexing)
- ✅ **Why single lock instead of per-key locks?** → File system events are low-frequency (human-speed operations); single lock is simpler and sufficient
- ✅ **Why three-level path resolution?** → Links may be stored with anchors (`file.md#section`), as relative paths (`../file.md`), or as filenames (`file.md`); multi-level resolution handles all cases without requiring parsers to normalize

**No open questions remaining** — feature is fully implemented and operational.

## 9. AI Agent Session Handoff Notes

This section maintains context between development sessions:

### Current Status

**Implementation Complete** (retrospective analysis — pre-framework implementation):
- All database operations implemented and tested
- Thread safety verified via concurrent access tests
- O(1) lookup performance confirmed
- Integration with service layer complete
- Unit tests provide 100% coverage of database operations

### Next Steps

**For ongoing work (Phase 3 documentation):**
- ✅ FDD created (PD-FDD-023)
- ✅ TDD created (PD-TDD-022) — this document
- ⬜ Update master state file to mark documentation complete
- ⬜ Continue with next Tier 2 feature documentation

### Key Decisions

**Documented in section 7 (Design Decisions) of [Feature Implementation State](../../../../state-tracking/features/archive/0.1.3-in-memory-database-implementation-state.md):**

1. **Target-indexed dictionary** for O(1) "what links to this file?" queries
2. **Single `threading.Lock`** for simplicity and deadlock-free thread safety
3. **Three-level path resolution** to handle anchors, relative paths, and filename-only references

### Known Issues

**No known issues** — feature is production-stable and has been operational since initial LinkWatcher 2.0 implementation.
