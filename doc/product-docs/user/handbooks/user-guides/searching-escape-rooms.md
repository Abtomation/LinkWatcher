## Tips and Best Practices

- **Use Specific Keywords**: Instead of general terms like "fun" or "exciting," use specific themes like "zombie," "detective," or "historical"
- **Save Favorite Searches**: If you frequently search with the same criteria, save your searches to quickly access them later
- **Enable Notifications**: For saved searches, enable notifications to be alerted when new escape rooms matching your criteria become available
- **Check Multiple Dates**: If you're flexible with your schedule, check multiple dates to find more options
- **Combine Filters Strategically**: Using too many filters might limit your results, so start with the most important criteria first
- **Read Reviews**: After finding potential matches, read reviews to get a better understanding of the experience

## Troubleshooting

### No Results Found

**Problem:** Your search returned no results.

**Solution:**
1. Try broadening your search criteria by:
   - Increasing the distance range
   - Removing some filters
   - Using more general keywords
2. Check if your location settings are accurate
3. Try searching for a different date or time
4. Check if you have an active internet connection

### Location Services Issues

**Problem:** The app cannot detect your location for "near me" searches.

**Solution:**
1. Ensure location services are enabled for the BreakoutBuddies app in your device settings
2. Grant the app permission to access your location if prompted
3. Restart the app and try again
4. If problems persist, enter your location manually

### Filter Not Working

**Problem:** A specific filter doesn't seem to be affecting your search results.

**Solution:**
1. Clear all filters and apply only the one you're having issues with
2. Check if there are conflicting filters applied
3. Update the app to the latest version
4. Report the issue through the app's feedback feature if it persists
