# AI Entry Point

This file serves as a marker for AI agents to identify the primary entry point for this project.

## Primary Entry Point

🚨 **MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: Before doing ANY work, you MUST select a task from:

[AI Task-Based Development System](ai-tasks.md)

**NO WORK can be done without first selecting an appropriate task.**

## General Instructions

- **⏱️ TIME TRACKING**: Always call `get_current_time` at the start of any task to begin time tracking for the entire session
- Always check the current date and time using the MCP server when working on tasks that require timestamps or dates
- **🚨 CRITICAL**: Every task has a mandatory completion checklist including feedback forms - tasks are NOT complete until all checklist items are finished
- **⏱️ DURATION CALCULATION**: When creating feedback forms, calculate session duration from start time and manually enter it in the feedback form template
- **📊 CONTEXT MANAGEMENT**: Always refer to the Context Map linked in each task's Context Requirements section to understand component relationships
- **🔍 VISUAL NOTATION**: Use the [Visual Notation Guide](/doc/process-framework/guides/guides/visual-notation-guide.md) to interpret all diagram formats
- **🔗 LINK MAINTENANCE**:
  - **🚨 CRITICAL**: ALWAYS start LinkWatcher at the beginning of each session: `LinkWatcher/start_linkwatcher_background.ps1`
  - LinkWatcher runs in background and automatically maintains all document references in real-time
  - Use any method to move/rename files (VS Code, File Explorer, git commands) - LinkWatcher handles all updates
- **⚙️ POWERSHELL SCRIPT EXECUTION**:
  - **🚨 CRITICAL**: When executing PowerShell scripts through the Bash tool, you MUST use the temp file pattern documented in each task
  - NEVER use `pwsh.exe -Command` - it will NOT capture output through the Bash tool
  - ALWAYS use: `echo Set-Location 'path'; ^& .\Script.ps1 -Params > temp.ps1 && pwsh.exe -File temp.ps1 && del temp.ps1`
  - See [Script Development Quick Reference](/doc/process-framework/guides/guides/script-development-quick-reference.md#powershell-script-output-not-visible-ai-agents) for details

## Purpose

This file is designed to be detected early in an AI agent's session to ensure the agent understands the task-based development approach used in this project before reading unnecessary files.
