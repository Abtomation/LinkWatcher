# New-RetrospectiveMasterState.ps1
# Creates a new Retrospective Master State file for onboarding an existing project into the process framework
# Used in step 2 of Codebase Feature Discovery (PF-TSK-064)

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Creates a new Retrospective Master State tracking file for framework onboarding.

.DESCRIPTION
    This PowerShell script generates the Retrospective Master State file by:
    - Generating a unique state tracking ID (PF-STA-XXX) automatically
    - Filling in the project name, start date, and initial status (DISCOVERY)
    - Placing the file at the standard location in state-tracking/temporary/
    - Updating the ID tracker in the central ID registry

    This file is shared across all three onboarding tasks (PF-TSK-064, PF-TSK-065, PF-TSK-066)
    and is archived upon completion of the full onboarding process.

.PARAMETER ProjectName
    Name of the project being onboarded into the process framework

.PARAMETER OpenInEditor
    If specified, opens the created file in the default editor

.EXAMPLE
    .\New-RetrospectiveMasterState.ps1 -ProjectName "LinkWatcher"

.EXAMPLE
    .\New-RetrospectiveMasterState.ps1 -ProjectName "MyProject" -OpenInEditor

.NOTES
    - The output file is placed in process-framework/state-tracking/temporary/
    - The file is TEMPORARY and will be archived when onboarding is complete
    - Only one retrospective master state file should exist per project at a time
    - Assigns a PF-STA-XXX ID from the central ID registry
